Its either you're aligned with the East or you're aligned with the West. \n\nEverything on this planet isn't a dichotomy. It isn't always us (the good guys) against them (the bad guys). There are various factors to play especially in a delicate dance like diplomacy with other nation states. \n\nDon't forget, for every Ukraine, there's a Vietnam War or the invasion of Iraq (something that wasn't supported by the UN member states). The \"bad guy\" can be anyone based on history with its neighbors or their past relations. \n\nClearly the US and Russia don't like each other and want to end each other's reign as a regional or global superpower. Russia doesn't want NATO nukes in their backyard just like how the US didn't want Soviet nukes pointed at them in Cuba (look up the Cuban missile crisis) and that country to this day can't buy a modern electric appliance thanks to the economic sanctions placed by Uncle Sam. If it makes sense, you can definitely put forth your points and we can have a meaningful debate instead of just name-calling and hurling insults at each other.",

Taiwan does take it seriously though because the risk is there.  So Taiwan has a significant military presence and assets tuned for protection.\n\nThe big problem is tech and all the businesses in Taiwan that only exist there because of the freedoms Taiwan has.  Any true unification would force a very large number of businesses and talent to flee that country.  Under China rule, your business is not owned by you.  Your land and capital is not owned by you.  Your company is not owned by you.  Everything is forfeit if leadership simply wills it.  All your IP is now China's, and you have no protection of any of it.\n\nEVERY SINGLE important company and EVERY SINGLE skilled person would be GONE, and China would be left with an empty shell worth jack shit to them.  And if assets can't be moved or moved in time, the obvious step would be to destroy the assets.  It's worth nothing to the fleeing company.  And it's actually dangerous to leave anything intact.  So I would also expect entire business infrastructures to be razed to the ground from within if any asset and IP risk was present.  It would have to be done to protect the IP.\n\nSo what is China left with?  Some more worthless land?  A population of people that hate them?  A complete void of all top tier talent and skill sets?  No standing businesses, assets, or IP of actual worth?  And because businesses would flee, you also have a large remaining population and remaining support businesses with nothing to support and no work to do.  So you also get high unemployment and a pile of worthless infrastructure that no longer serves any purpose.\n\nI'm pretty sure China knows this all too well too.  It's why nothing ever happens.  It's why everything is posturing and a show.  That's because that's all it can ever be or China actually wrecks it all for no positive gain.  At best, it would be solely an action of spite and hate, and fulfill some brief satisfaction, but even after that you've got nothing of any good at the other end.",

And these could be heavily defended. The PRC could seize fishing villages or a port for larger scale landings. But the view has been that any attempt to take the islands by force would mean landing in predictable places. These new barges change that.\n\n>The extreme reach of the Bailey Bridges means that the PRC could land at sites previously considered unsuitable. They can land across rocky, or soft, beaches, delivering the tanks directly to firmer ground or a coastal road. This allows China to pick new landing sites and complicate attempts to organize defences. Instead of relying on Taiwanese ports, China can now sail its own mobile port across the straits\n\nSure, but equally it makes those new beaches extremely vulnerable because the number of available landing vessels would be so small, and the vessels themselves so valuable.",

I personally blame the convicted oxygen thief (and future prison wife)\u00a0Ian \"Ballistic Missiles are\u00a0Literally\u00a0Overpriced Artillery Shells\" Easton\u00a0for this notion.\n\nThe common trope is that the PLA will build up a large land component force over a period of time, will secure all of their available shipping assets, and will attempt to embark and debark as large of a force as is physically possible onto Taiwan's (now defended, mined, prepared, and targeted) few feasible D-Day style landing beaches at the outset of hostilities.\n\nThis is uh, well, it's not at all how the PLA intends to do things lol. Not even close, actually. It's mostly just perpetuated because of folks like the aforementioned Ian Easton writing dogshit publications such as \"The Chinese Invasion Threat,\" and due to the fact that until around the 2010s or so, this wasn't *tooooo* far from the truth.\n\nUp until relatively recently, US intervention should Taiwan be invaded and fall in a matter of days was not really seen as guaranteed. If the PLA could generate and successfully land a large enough \"first-wave\" amphibious force, then exploit successful beachheads to bypass/overwhelm/repel ROC defenders via massed fires, aggressive maneuver, and the sheer \"mass\" of the landing force. If this could be done, and the ROC defeated in a short enough period of time, US intervention could have been stopped, and the war won without a larger conflict arising. To accomplish this, the entirety of the PLAN's amphibious fleet, the entirety of the PRC's dual-use civilian shipping capacity, the maritime militia's ferry capacity, and the integral amphibious capbility of PLA vehicles would have been needed to rapidly embark, transport, and land the seriously large force needed to overcome the aforementioned preparation that the ROC would have done prior to initiation of hostilities.\n\nThis was pre-2012 though, and post 2016 reform (and *especially* post 2019 or so due to geopolitics) it is no longer seen as likely for the US to \"sit out\" a Taiwan war, and it's geeeenerally believed within the PLA that if the US enters the war, it won't just like... say \"oh Taiwan surrendered, i guess that's it guys, gg\" in the event of the ROC falling. Thus, the \"fait-accompli\" style of operation no longer carries it's singular, central benefit of preventing US intervention, and thus it is no longer a prudent use of resources to perform such a day 1 assault against prepared positions following a protracted build up of a massive invasion force.",

This happened right before America started focusing on Huawei hardware. Rumor at the time was that Huawei actually refused to give access to the security holes in its hardware/ software to the United States, but had given it to the Chinese government. This is how the entire Saga of Sanctioning Huawei began. People just seem to forget in a very short duration. China was just made the scapegoat, who knows what other countries /entities were using the same security vulnerabilities.\n\nJust close them? but  cant since then how would you spy on the citizens?",

However, it changed course over the weekend and is now parked at sea with the oil on board.\n\n>According to Bloomberg, this vessel, along with many others, has been subjected to the most aggressive\u00a0package of measures\u00a0aimed at Russian oil exports since the invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.\n\n>Another tanker, the Mermar, left Kozmino on 5 January with more than 755,000 barrels of ESPO on board and was due to call at the port of Yantai this week, but is now waiting off the coast.\n\n>The Olia left the Russian port on 7 January with almost 709,000 barrels of the same grade and was also bound for Yantai but is now in the Yellow Sea.\n\n>The tankers are not offloading days after Shandong Port Group Co., which operates several ports in the province, called on terminals to stop allowing sanctioned oil tankers to dock or unload cargo.\n\n>**Background**:\n\n>The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control has\u00a0imposed sanctions\u00a0on two of Russia's largest oil companies, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as ship insurance providers Ingosstrakh and AlfaStrakhovanie.\n\n>According to the\u00a0Financial Times, the measures include the blacklisting of 183 ships of the \"shadow fleet\" involved in energy exports from Russia.",

May he also grant us a victory in our own land!\u201d\n\nThe TIP has been based in Syria for more than a decade, with its members fleeing to the Middle East to escape\u00a0China\u2019s severe oppression of the Uyghurs, a largely Muslim minority group. Its fighters joined\u00a0Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive, in a thrust out of the north-west of Syria.\n\nIn recent days TIP has engaged in an unusual publicity blitz, showcasing its leader Abu Muhammed alongside his battalions.\n\nOne video claims to show the TIP fighting against Assad\u2019s forces on the front lines in late November 2024, shortly after the rebel offensive was launched. Another shows TIP fighters rolling into Damascus on tanks, waving light blue flags bearing the group\u2019s crescent-and-star symbol.\n\nAccording to the video captions, TIP fighters entered the strategic port cities of Latakia and Tartus on Dec 10 and 11. Both are situated along Syria\u2019s coastline and\u00a0previously hosted Russian forces.\n\n\u201cSo many groups allied against us. Russia came, Iran came, Hezbollah came \u2013 with strong weapons and all kinds of soldiers,\u201d said one man in the Dec 8 video. \u201cBut each time, Allah as our witness, we did not retreat.\n\n\u201cWith the help of Allah, we have fought our way here. We did not once show weakness or fear; we were never afraid.\u201d\n\nTIP certainly had a role to play in the rebel victory, said Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, an independent researcher who specialises in the Syrian civil war.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t necessarily a larger force than the other Syrian insurgent groups that\u00a0were assisting HTS, but they were part of the offensive,\u201d he said.\n\n**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/13/uyghur-fighters-in-syria-vow-to-come-for-china-next/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/13/uyghur-fighters-in-syria-vow-to-come-for-china-next/)",

On one hand, there\u2019s this deep cultural emphasis on justice and accountability, especially for brutal crimes like this one. On the other, Taiwan takes so much pride in its progressiveness and human rights record that executions feel like they clash with that identity.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how public opinion seems to overwhelmingly support capital punishment, even in such a modern democracy. But honestly, executions like this raise tough questions: Does it truly serve justice, or is it more about closure and public sentiment? Rights groups argue it\u2019s a step backward, but for victims\u2019 families, it likely feels like justice was finally served. It\u2019s such a complicated debate, and Taiwan is really caught between tradition and its aspirations as a global leader in human rights. What do you think, can capital punishment ever coexist with a commitment to human rights?",

The fact that this vessel loitered for weeks near key communication cables without any clear purpose only adds to suspicions, especially when considered alongside Russia's known seabed warfare capabilities. This isn\u2019t the first time vessels linked to Russia have been spotted near such infrastructure, and it\u2019s unsettling to think about the potential for sabotage, particularly with how critical these cables are for global communication and commerce. If these cables were to be damaged, the financial and logistical fallout would be enormous, not to mention the strain on international relations. It\u2019s a stark reminder of how modern warfare isn\u2019t just fought on battlefields but increasingly in shadowy, non-traditional arenas like cyberspace and underwater.\n\nThe swift response from NATO to enhance vigilance in regions like the Baltic shows the growing awareness of these threats, but the question remains: how do you effectively deter such actions when they\u2019re shrouded in plausible deniability? This is the kind of hybrid warfare that\u2019s hard to counter without escalating into outright conflict. Hopefully, continued international cooperation and surveillance can help prevent further incidents, but it\u2019s clear this kind of activity isn\u2019t going away anytime soon!",

They were from much more vulnerable systems like SM-3 or SM-6 missiles too. You aren't looking to recreate these from leaked data so much as you're trying to jam or otherwise defeat them. SM-6 for example. Typically a ship launched anti-air-threat missile of considerable size. It was recently strapped underneath navy F-18's and re-designated AIM-174, now the longest range and most capable air-to-air missile in inventory. Though, just a stopgap until newer missiles are fielded in numbers, because the US was falling behind the in very-long-range AA missile race. It's a shame the latest and greatest is at least partially leaked already - isn't it?\n\nAny state with access to any non-public data on these systems - including F-35, B-2 and others - can use it to significant effect in the real world. Don't downplay it. If someone steals a picture of your housekey they aren't trying to copy the lock & key that protect you. They're trying to find a way in your house. When they want, and preferably without you knowing they can. Don't make the mistake of thinking these secrets weren't 'secret enough' to matter. They all matter. The goal isn't to be you.

Those programs are so compartmentalized that one single person could have classified data that is the equivalent of a stress test result for the rivets. Yes, any little bit helps, but there are varying degrees of importance between classified material. Now if one of those people had the chemical composition of the RAM coating for the F-22, that would be a big deal, so who knows.

They know that if there is a Taiwan contingency, the tool kit that will be applied against them will be similar,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.\n\nRussia\u2019s economy defied expectations after Western sanctions were imposed, with consumer confidence increasing and wages growing in the months after the invasion.\n\nHowever, the Kremlin was recently forced to reassure Russians who feared they would be significantly impacted by the sudden collapse of the rouble, which plunged to its lowest level since the invasion began.\n\nThe creation of a task force reflects deepening relations between Beijing and Moscow. Chinese companies are believed to be\u00a0[playing a pivotal role](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/26/xi-jinping-already-outmanoeuvred-donald-trump-tariff-war/)\u00a0in the supply of weapons used by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nIt also reflects concerns in Beijing over the $3.3 trillion it holds in foreign-exchange reserves \u2013 the largest in the world.\n\nOfficials in China have therefore been tasked with\u00a0[diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/12/24/xi-jinping-china-dollar-dominance-saudi-arabia-deal/), including American treasury bonds.\n\nWestern sanctions on China triggered by an invasion of Taiwan could put $3.7 trillion in Chinese\u00a0[overseas bank assets and reserves at risk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/05/12/china-fortifying-economy-war-with-west/), according to a report by the Atlantic Council and Rhodium Group .\n\nOne lesson China has learnt from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is preparation, according to analysts, after watching how Russia diversified foreign reserves and de-dollarised its economy in the months before February 2022.\n\n**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/01/china-russia-central-bank-ukraine-taiwan-us-sanctions/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/01/china-russia-central-bank-ukraine-taiwan-us-sanctions/)",

What really put the Allies over the top was the element of surprise.

        "body": "\\[SS from the article by Brendan Rittenhouse Green, Professor of Political Science at theUniversity of Cincinnati, and Caitlin Talmadge, Professor of Security Studies at the Walsh School ofForeign Service at Georgetown University\\]\n\n\"Of all the intractable issues that could spark a hot war between the United States and China, Taiwan is at the very top of the list. And the potential geopolitical consequences of such a war would be profound. Taiwan\u2014\u201can unsinkable aircraft carrier and submarine tender,\u201d as U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur once described it\u2014has important, often underappreciated military value as a gateway to the Philippine Sea, a vital theater for defending Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea from possible Chinese coercion or attack. There is no guarantee that China would win a war for the island\u2014or that such a conflict wouldn\u2019t drag on for years and weaken China. But if Beijing gained control of Taiwan and based military assets there, China\u2019s military position would improve markedly.\n\nBeijing\u2019s ocean surveillance assets and submarines, in particular, could make control of Taiwan a substantial boon to Chinese military power. Even without any major technological or military leaps, possession of the island would improve China\u2019s ability to impede U.S. naval and air operations in the Philippine Sea and thereby limit the United States\u2019 ability to defend its Asian allies. And if, in the future, Beijing were to develop a large fleet of quiet nuclear attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines, basing them on Taiwan would enable China to threaten Northeast Asian shipping lanes and strengthen its sea-based nuclear forces.\n\nClearly, the island\u2019s military value bolsters the argument for keeping Taiwan out of China\u2019s grasp. The strength of that case, however, depends on several factors, including whether one assumes that China would pursue additional territorial expansion after occupying Taiwan and make the long-term military and technological investments needed to take full advantage of the island. It also depends on the broader course of U.S. China policy. Washington could remain committed to its current approach of containing the expansion of Chinese power through a combination of political commitments to U.S. partners and allies in Asia and a significant forward military presence. Or it might adopt a more flexible policy that retains commitments only to core treaty allies and reduces forward deployed forces. Or it might reduce all such commitments as part of a more restrained approach. Regardless of which of these three strategies the United States pursues, however, Chinese control of Taiwan would limit the U.S. military\u2019s ability to operate in the Pacific and would potentially threaten U.S. interests there.\n\nBut the issue is not just that Taiwan\u2019s tremendous military value poses problems for any U.S. grand strategy. It is that no matter what Washington does\u2014whether it attempts to keep Taiwan out of Chinese hands or not\u2014it will be forced to run risks and incur costs in its standoff with Beijing. As the place where all the dilemmas of U.S. policy toward China collide, Taiwan presents one of the toughest and most dangerous problems in the world. Simply put, Washington has few good options there and a great many bad ones that could court calamity.\"",

        "body": "The biggest problem I have with the focus on containing China is that there's so much focus on the military question of China that the more import economic issue is largely ignored.\n\nTaiwan is just not worth risking an escalating war that would devastate the world economy (even without nukes). If we think the current impacts of the Ukraine are bad as far as gas prices and the coming food shortage (maybe leading to famine in some countries), a war in East Asia would be that on steroids.\n\nThe biggest oil producer in the world engaging in a conflict in the part of the world that produces the majority of finished and unfinished goods would be devastating. It would be a naval war, so basically almost no commercial ships would be getting in or out.\n\nThe world's economy relies on those supply chains, and everything would come to a grinding halt until factories could be build elsewhere.\n\nWe should do everything we can to avoid that.\n\nIn my opinion the real issue with China is the economic one.\n\nIn no world prior to this current one does it make sense for the US Dollar to be so strong and the Chinese Yuan to be so weak comparatively.\n\nChina should not be able to run a persistent trade surplus and the US to run a persistent deficit. For that to happen, it requires heavy, heavy manipulation. The usual way that trade balances is the country with the surplus, China, would have their currency strengthen, and the deficit country, the US, would have their currency weaken. That would mean two things, the US, w/ a weaker currency, can afford fewer Chinese goods, and the good the US manufactures would be more competitive, which means the Chinese could afford to buy more of them. Both of these mechanisms would balance trade.\n\nWhy doesn't this happen? Because China manipulates their currency massively, and they do this by buying US assets, which strengthens the dollar artificially and weakens the Yuan artificially, meaning the US can continue to afford Chinese goods, and the Chinese cannot afford US goods.\n\nFrom the perspective of economic efficiency this makes zero sense. Unsubsidized electricity in the US is so much cheaper in most regions than the true cost of electricity in China. It is nonsensical to produce anything where energy costs are much larger than labor costs in China instead of the US.\n\nThe reason that this doesn't happen is China doesn't care about economic efficiency, they care about economic output. They pursue a supply side economic system, which means that they produce good whether or not it makes economic sense to produce them.\n\nThis means two things Chinese consumption as a percent of GDP is very low compared to other countries, which means they can't consume enough of the goods that China produces.And it means that once China's labor costs started to rise (the most efficient part of their economy originally), the only way to meet continuing economic growth targets was through a massive, massive increase in debt.\n\nThis is terrible for the world economy because it introduces a huge amount of inefficiency into the system that at some point will have to be adjusted for. China won't be able to grow their debt indefinitely, so when that adjustment comes a large part of the world's energy-intensive, low labor manufacturing will be located in a part of the world where it's much more expensive to produce those goods.\n\nNot to mention the impact this system has on the Chinese population. Because of their supply-side system, Chinese workers own comparatively a very small portion of the country's GDP, meaning they're relatively poorer than other countries. This being the case it's not a surprise that the majority of the most expensive cost of living cities when you factor in average wage are in China.\n\nChina's inefficient system will undoubtably cause major issues for the Chinese population and the world economy at large down the road unless significant reforms are made.\n\nThe US and the rest of the world should be laser focused on economic reforms in dealing with China instead of military considerations.",

        "body": "The article's subtitle should be: There Must Be 100 Whys to Keep an Island. Most of them are strategic nonsense. \n\nThe threat posed by Chinese submarines and \"underwater surveillance devices\" doesn't change whether they're based off the mainland or Taiwan. Russia has submarines in the Pacific. Germany contested the Atlantic in WW2 with no need for a base in the area. Submarines can effectively go anywhere - decoupling power projection from territorial possession is kind of the big point of submarines. \n\n> If China were to take the island swiftly and easily, many of its military assets geared toward a Taiwan campaign might be freed up to pursue other military objectives. \n\nChina doesn't have *any* forces that are so locked on Taiwan they're unable to do anything else. No troops will be \"freed up\" by taking Taiwan. If anything it will be the opposite - a forced occupation of Taiwan could require China to commit tens of thousands of soldiers to pacification...forever. \n\n> possession of the island would improve China\u2019s ability to impede U.S. naval and air operations in the Philippine Sea and thereby limit the United States\u2019 ability to defend its Asian allies. \n\nIf the Philippines were concerned about that, they wouldn't have kicked the US [out of their country](http://www.subicbaypi.com/) The Philippines can still invite the US back (and most likely would if Beijing took Taiwan). \n\n> China\u2019s growing missile capabilities render land-based aircraft and their regional bases increasingly vulnerable, forcing the United States to rely more heavily on aircraft and missiles launched from ships.\n\nLast year the 7th Fleet Admiral called for more carriers. [6 or 7 or 8 carriers](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10259469/US-Seventh-Fleets-commander-calls-aircraft-carriers-Pacific-deter-China-Russia.html).  ~~This would represent an investment of 50% of US GDP cruising around the Pacific.~~ With China launching more carriers, the number of carriers the US would require will only increase. It's a bad strategy, but the US doesn't have any better options so long as allies like the Philippines are hostile to the idea of hosting US bases. If China *does* start threatening other countries, this reticence may disappear. Just as likely, the Philippines will pivot their alignment to China. So maybe investing the ~~$1T or so~~ money that goes into a carrier group might be better invested in building positive relations with these countries. \n\n> If a war in the Pacific were to break out today, China\u2019s ability to conduct effective over-the-horizon attacks\u2014that is, attacks targeting U.S. ships at distances that exceed the line of sight to the horizon\u2014would be more limited than commonly supposed.\n\nChina's CMF strategy gives them naval options that are pretty unique. They have over 100k vessels that have been rudimentarily operationalized. Most of these are designed to be 'spam' targets, but a fleet of 10k helpless civil vessels spiked with a few hundred ships armed with anti-ship and anti-aircraft platforms would be a novel threat. Does the USN sink every fishing boat they see when there are thousands of them? They certainly can't wait until those ships transmit the position of US carriers. \n\n> Without intelligence from these specialized signal-collecting assets, China\u2019s imaging satellites would be left to randomly search vast swaths of ocean for U.S. forces. \n\nHere the proposition is that US carriers will be able to conceal their position from China because the ocean's too big to image via satellite. It's nonsensical. There should be zero doubt that China has automated procedures to surveil the regions China is concerned about. Their goal is area denial - they only have to monitor the areas that put the US within attack range. Taiwan doesn't factor into this at all. \n\nThere are many good reasons to value Taiwan's independence. Self-determination and democracy are important values. TSMC is a keystone of global technology. And oppression like we've seen in Hong Kong is repugnant. \n\nThe military argument is far less compelling. US hegemony over the Pacific has been a boon to everyone for 75 years, but those days are over.",

I wonder if that should be re-evaluated. \n\nIn a recent discussion about Taiwan, and China vs. America in general, I started discussing the long term US military advantages that many analysts bring up as factors in the conflict. The US can deny China resources to strangle it slowly. If China takes Taiwan quickly, the US can cut off Taiwan and slowly move to take it back with allies, etc. There are some things that China has no military defense against, such as resource denial.\n\nOne poster brought up an interesting point. A more qualified version of it is that nothing medium or long term matters. China just needs to be able to amass enough firepower to achieve a quick objective, like taking Taiwan. In his opinion, there is NOTHING but short-term because within a week of any direct conflict between the US and China, nuclear brinksmanship will be employed to freeze the game, and so whoever is ahead after a few days always wins. Taiwan can never be retaken. Blockades can never happen. These all involve timelines that are too long. Whatever China says about no-first strike policies, if China is ahead early it will play the nuclear card fast to lock in its gains and end the conventional game.\n\nI'm not sure about this.

The answer is to have an Asian nuclear ally in the region to lead the non-nuclear states. India is not a trustworthy ally of the US; as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, it is clear that India has different agendas from the US.\n\nThe UK and France could provide the rest of Europe with a nuclear umbrella because they were in the same trajectory if the USSR launched a missile at West Germany.  But the US tried to bring the UK missiles under US (NATO) control which it managed to do in the early 1980s.  It couldn't do so with France.  So Australia is going to lob nukes at Beijing if Tokyo is attacked.\n\nTo be honest this is way out of my depth, but I am old enough to studied with professors who main line of work was proliferation.

        "body": "Submission Statement:\n\nThis article discusses how a potential conflict between the US and Chinese military would go based on several war-games that the US has conducted and the reasons for a US loss. The article begins talking about recent rising tensions between the USA and China regarding the Taiwan issue, in particular about how quickly China has been in responding to several gaffes made by Biden in regards to the long term US policy on Taiwan independence. China has said on several occasions that it would be willing to start a war over Taiwan and hence it is very important that this issue is treated carefully given the potential consequences if things should change from how they are now.\n\nThe article continues by talking about China will have learnt not just from the failures of the Russian military in Ukraine recently, but overall from how the US fights wars over the past few decades. Chinese doctrine has not stood still but has been updating itself too, focusing into a more modern  \u201cinformationised warfare\u201d doctrine, which the article discusses. In particularly it talks about how the doctrine would apply to a potential war over Taiwan where war-games show China consistently winning. One of the major factors causing this according to the article is that China is rapidly advancing in missile technology, and not with small amounts of missiles but with large amounts, which would devastate US military bases in the Western Pacific. In addition, China would have the logistics advantage being much closer to Taiwan geographically, and the US has few allies who would also help Taiwan in a potential conflict.\n\nExpanding on the point about missiles, the war-games suggest that the large number of ground-based ballistic missiles that China possesses would be able to hit the most important military bases the US has in the area, Guam, Japan, Diego Garcia. Likewise, new bombers with cruise missiles could also hit these bases. In addition new anti-ship ballistic missiles would also pose a threat. The article warns China is outpacing the US in terms of raw numbers of missiles, and particular long-range ones, saying that this was one of the reasons Trump pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in 2019. The article finishes off by discussing how any future anti-ICBM technology is still a long way off.\n\nI think there are couple key points here worth discussing:\n\n- Would China really go to war with the US over Taiwan? It's such a small island and personally I cannot imagine how anyone rational would risk war over it regardless of what they say.\n\n- What is the extent of the missile gap talked about in the article? The US by far spends the most money on it's military, so you would expect it should be the leader in most areas of military weaponry, however apparently it isn't the case for long-range ballistic missiles. If so, what should be done about it?\n\n- One additional question which isn't the focus of the article but is more concerned with military spending, I've seen several analysts talk about how fast Ukraine is burning through their own and Western supply military arms. What implications does this have regarding the overall speed of military production in the US? If it will take years to replenish arms to their stocks before the war, would this not give China an advantage knowing that the US is lacking in supplies for certain stocks of arms?",

It's not a coincidence that Pakistan and North Korea have nuclear weapons that effectively checkmate India and South Korea. China subsidizes both countries to the point where they are able to have reliable nuclear deterrents.\n\nAt the very least Japan will need to nuclearize as will South Korea. Possibly Singapore as well. It's the only way to guarantee China never gets past the first island chain. It's unlikely China will even object to be honest. The double standard of having helped Pakistan and North Korea develop nuclear weapons while simultaneously trying to deny that right other countries is simply too comical to be taken seriously and they know it. Effectively the strategy that the world will use to contain China will be the same strategy China uses to contain India and South Korea. This is an elegant solution and it speaks to the wisdom of the Communist Party that they were able to develop a strategy that has so far helped prevent any truly catastrophic wars in the region.",

[No paywall](https://archive.is/JMpfK)\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe term Indo-Pacific was first coined by the [German classical geopolitical thinker,  Karl Haushofer in 1920, it wasn't used extensive until recently in international relations.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/indopacific-intellectual-origins-and-international-visions-in-global-contexts/21B142B132F694349D46CAD22EA8C7CD)\n\n**MODERN ORIGINS OF INDO-PACIFIC**\n\n1. In 2007, Shinzo Abe, an early proponent of the Quad, took to the stage during a visit to India and borrowed a phrase from a 17th-century Mughal prince. Abe proposed there was a \u201cconfluence of the two seas\u201d between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, using the speech to trace deep civilizational ties between the two.  The Japanese saw it as a way of bringing in India to contain China\n2. The Australians advanced the idea after Abe left office in 2007 after his shock election defeat.  Australia was more comfortable with a broader definition than being a part of \"Asia\".   Rory Medcalf, who heads up the [National Security College at the Australian National University and who wrote a book on the rise of the Indo-Pacific. \u201cAustralia was the first country to really seriously codify the Indo-Pacific in policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/30/biden-pacific-china/).\u201d\n3. The Japanese, Indians and Australia all stand to benefit from it.\n4. While the Pentagon started talking about the Indo-Pacific as early as 2002, it didn't strike the popular imagination US policy makers until Robert Kaplan's Monsoon  which popularized the idea that the Indian  Ocean would take center stage in the twenty-first-century strategy  games of great powers.\u00a0 The author says that it merited attention because \"real patterns crisscrossing the Pacific  and Indian Oceans: energy corridors, shipping containers filled with  Gucci bags and iPhones, migration, terrorism\"\n\nHowever, the author doesn't mention two significant events / individuals, China's Belt and road, and Harry Harris use of the term.\n\n1. Chinese President Xi Jinping had announced a strategy that would become the Belt and Road Initiative in a September 2013 visit to Kazakhstan, [a sign China\u2019s appetite for economic expansion throughout Asia was greater than ever, and later stressed a maritime component of the ambitious initiative in a trip to Indonesia.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/30/biden-pacific-china/)\n2. Harry Harris, the U.S. military commander of the Pacific Command from 2014-2018 used to term  Indo-Asia-Pacific to describe the Pacific Commands jurisdiction which stretched from   all U.S. troops from Hawaii to the edge of the Persian Gulf. In May 30 2018  **United States Pacific Command** was changed to United States Indo-Pacific Command . The Trump administration quickly got behind idea\n\nThe Trump administration adopted it, because it opened another front to compete with Beijing, and Biden has continued the policy\n\n**CRITICISM OF THE INDO-PACIFIC**\n\nThe author's criticism of using the term rest on three arguments\n\n1. East Asia hasn't fought a war since 1979, whereas Pakistan and India have gone to war once, and had 5 border conflicts.  This \u201cAsian peace\u201d is the product of a  number of factors, including U.S. forward military presence and  alliances, Sino-U.S. d\u00e9tente, economic interdependence, regional norms  and multilateral architecture, and the spread of democracy in some  quarters.\n2. The United States risks overextending its power in the  Indian Ocean region. Washington enjoys many advantages and retains many  interests in East Asia and the Pacific: these regions contain five U.S.  treaty allies and 80,000 US Troops in Korea and Japan. The US doesn't have similar basing arrangements or alliance in the Indian Ocean\n3. It distracts from heavy work needed in East Asia.  Even under the Trump administration there has been push back ***From a military perspective, the focus really needs to be tightly on the Pacific, especially the first island chain and Taiwan,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Trump administration who helped craft the 2018 National Defense Strategy. \u201cThe Indian Ocean is a distinctly secondary theater for the United States and shouldn\u2019t distract from that primary focus.***\n\nWhile the author doesn't advocate neglecting the region, he argues given the region's relative unimportance to the US and the US lack of capacity in the region, people should be realistic. Initiatives should be low cast and risk, and the Quad qualifies as such.",

It may eventually prove either impossible or too costly to oppose China within range of its many missiles, whose range and capabilities grow every day. At some point, actually preventing China from taking Taiwan may become nearly impossible. Some analysts think we have already reached this point. Other thinkers point to the fact even if defending Taiwan is possible, why should the US funnel all of its resources into a battleground where China enjoys an enormous geographic advantage due to Taiwan's proximity to the mainland. \n\nAmerica's big stick in the conflict with China has always been maritime disruption of China's access to raw materials and world markets. For the foreseeable future, China have little military answer to such a strategy; it's only hope lies in a diplomatic strategy of making such disruption too costly to the US due to world opinion turning against America should the US Navy disrupt Chinese trade. \n\nGiven the above analysis, one can see that the Indian Ocean, which is the first leg in the journey of Persian Gulf oil to China, could become an essential battleground should the US decide it needs to pursue a naval disruption strategy against China. And it would not be an entirely one-way fight, as China (and potentially Russia) have some degree of blue water submarine capabilities which could also disrupt oil and other trade transiting the Indian Ocean on its way to America's East Asia allies.",

Satoshi Suzuki, a Japanese official, and Brian Hook, his U.S. counterpart, zoomed in on almost every touch point in Asia: the honeymoon between then-newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump and then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emergence of India, and a potential flare-up on the Korean Peninsula. And then Suzuki widened the lens.\n\n>The Japanese side presented a series of maps, labeled \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u201d Suzuki told Hook that Tokyo wanted to radically redraw the geography of the region, from the north-south orientation of the World War II era focused on the first and second island chains of the western Pacific Ocean to a two-ocean strategy that envisioned Japanese policy in Asia stretching to India and even as far as the Persian Gulf.\n\n>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the old and more narrow Asia-Pacific. It was the broader Indo-Pacific, and it recognized the significance of India in particular,\u201d said a former senior Trump administration official. \u201cIt was a sense that, you know, we weren\u2019t going to get what we wanted by asking Beijing nicely.\u201d\n\n>Something clicked. The idea caught fire in Washington. Hook quickly began briefing the idea to then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and shared the Japanese maps with European allies. The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, had been looking for a way to bring India in from the cold of its nonaligned Cold War stance and focus on China. Now, the Japanese were giving the new U.S. administration a way to say it.\n\n>Four years and a change of administrations later, the Indo-Pacific remains the flavor du jour of U.S. policy in Asia. The first foreign visits of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration touched down in Japan and India. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are currently on their own Indo-Pacific tours. Meanwhile, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (known as the Quad) partnership that also includes the United States and Australia is one of the most buzzed-about diplomatic groupings around.\n\n>And the shift in tone, spurred by Japan and encouraged by Australia, has major implications for U.S. military strategy as the Biden administration decides how\u2014and where\u2014it will counter China\u2019s rise",

Here is the logic behind the unilateral approach\n\n1. The multilateral approach won't work in many issues such as the trade deficit, commercial espionage and intellectual property, because US and her allies have different interest with regard to these issues. Germany and Japan and trade surpluses with China, while the US runs a deficit. In order to reach a consensus means the West has to compromise among themselves, and the end result if the type of toothless resolutions you commonly find in ASEAN regarding the SCS. Does America want to \"compromise\" its interest to appease a politician like Justin Trudeau? Not to mention opposition from domestic interest. TPP was opposed by both Clinton and Trump during the election.\n2. You can't launch a geopolitical front against China using a newly formed trade block like the TPP. Some of the existing TPP members are in economic groups with China, like Malaysia and Australia.\n3. China has joined a multitude of international bodies, and at least in trade, these bodies haven't changed its behavior.\n4. Dealing with China, its a no win situation whether you use a tough multilateral / unilateral approach. If the US endorse a tough unilateral approach gives the impression that the US is acting like the British during the Opium War. If you take a concerted Western approach you are accused of acting like the 8 Powers Alliance in 1900.\n5. Trump was elected to deal with China which he and his supporters believe was responsible for the loss of millions manufacturing jobs when China joined the WTO in 2001. It is estimate the US lost 6 Million jobs, about 1/4 of US manufacturing Jobs. This has been subsequently advanced by some [economists.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-really-is-to-blame-for-millions-of-lost-us-manufacturing-jobs-new-study-finds-2018-05-14) The ball got rolling when Bill Clinton decided to grant China Most Favored Nation status in 1999, just a decade after Tiananmen.\n6. China hasn't dealt with issues like IP protection, market access, subsidies to state own companies and state funded industrial spying.\n\nThe reality is Biden/Democrats are much more able to take the political hits than Republican candidate with regards to a trade war. Democrats dib;t depend on key voting blocs like farmers in swing states. For the Democrats among their voting base, most of the pain is spread out in terms of higher bills, which most people don't notice.While Trump's approach is harsh, the end result will most likely will fall short; however, that is the point, no policy directive will be 100% effective.Trump's tariffs were never meant to bring back jobs to the US, but shift production out of China. This will strength the economies of ASEAN / India, which in the long run will help them balance China.  Secondly, its easier to a country like Philippines to improve working conditions / environment than China",

        "body": "Hello, thanks for your great post. From time to time I've looked into this topic and there's some places where my understanding is slightly different from yours. \n\nFirst of all for what government are saying it's always better to use the primary source of what the government themselves are saying (rather than relying on what other people say they are saying). \n\nFor Japan's position I think these are easier to understand links (they are Japanese government webpages whose sole purpose is to discuss the Senkaku situaton)\n\nhttps://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/c_m1/senkaku/page1we_000010.html\n\nhttps://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/senkaku/qa_1010.html\n\nI don't know of any similar US, Taiwan or PRC webpages, but it would be nice to see such things. \n\nA small point\n\n>The contested islets and rocks are located at about 170 km northwest of Japan's Ishigaki Island/Okinawa Prefecture, at approximately 170 km northeast of Taiwan, and roughly 330 km off the coast of mainland China. \n\nPossibly this is slightly misleading, the inhabited Japanese island of Yonaguni is closer to 150 km from the Senkakus. (This also illustrates a kind of problem  with the website that can not be named and my claim is easy to check.) Or maybe there are also some closer inhabited Taiwanese islands. \n\n\n\nJapanese Position\n\nI think you are missing what I would consider one of the strongest arguments from the Japanese side (as expressed in the links).  It was not until the 1970s that the PRC and ROC started to make territorial claims on the Senkakus. (Though you did allude to this argument by saying it is the 50th anniversary of the dispute)\n\nThe ROC in 1920 considered (or at least referred to) the Senkakus as part of Okinawa prefecture (so in particular not part of Taiwan). More significantly in the 1950s the PRC (through official media and maps) referred to the Senkakus as part of the Ryukyus or Okinawa. \n\nThere's many more details, of course you were just giving an overview. \n\nPRC/ROC Position\n\nIt would be nice to see some official reasoning from their foreign ministries (rather than secondary sources talking about what they think the PRC or ROC thinks sorry if your links had such sources, but I couldn't see any. So for example some information on this could be in the link to the PRC coast guard law). Are there such primary sources or do the PRC and ROC prefer to remain more flexible with their arguments?\n\nOne thing I would really like to know. Are the PRC claims specific? Or like the SCS claims are they vague claims to the Senkakus that could easily be expanded to claim more of the Ryukyus or other territory.  \n\nUS Position\n\n>Since 1972, the US has held a neutral position on the sovereignty of the disputed islands.\n\nI guess that's true, but AFAIK the US administered the Senkakus from the 1950s to 1972 and returned them to Japanese administration in 1972. By extension I take this to say that the US does/did not consider the Senkakus part of Taiwan (in the sense of Taiwan covered by the WW2 treaties and other documents). \n\nSo maybe formally neutral on sovereignty but also contradicting a key link in the ROC/PRC argument. \n\nAlso since 1972 the US also consistently considered them as Japanese administered. I don't know if the PRC or ROC considers them as Japanese administered or concedes they were US administered before 1972 (if not then that would mean that the US backs the Japanese position more than the PRC or ROC one).",

One thing you left out which I think is quite important is China's usage of rare earth trade disruptions to leverage the issue. This led to some quite significant strategic long-term changes in Tokyo in terms of securing access to rare earths imports.",

        "body": "For those interested in a more detailed account of some of the \"incidents\" that have occured this year between the US, Taiwan, and China, \n\nhttps://jamestown.org/program/military-activity-and-political-signaling-in-the-taiwan-strait-in-early-2020/ provides a good synopsis\n\nEach of the governments involved likely sees shows of military force as a low risk and low cost way of both reassuring and distracting their populations during this time. \n\nIn this sense China's behavior probably deviates a little from the norm more due to the fact that their implicit propaganda goal is to convince the populace that their carrier groups stack up to the two American fleets in the Pacific (and the Japanese \"carrier\" destroyer groups). Normally Beijing has to be very careful in messaging as if America decides to test any fleet action the Chinese groups would be forced to turn and substantial loss of face would occur and the gap in carrier group effectiveness becomes obvious. Functionally the Chinese carriers of the Liaoning class are ineffective training vessels whose main value aside from developing doctrine is to on paper reassure the population that the balance of power in what China considers its \"territorial waters\" is not currently as lopsided as it is.\n\nHowever with the American fleet incapacitated the percieved risk of the lack of actual military capacity of the carriers becoming exposed is minimized, and easy propaganda points can be scored by unprecedented activities via its carrier groups, which both highlight the illusion of Chinese naval dominance as well as implicitly throw jabs at the US handling of the coronavirus \n\nhttps://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/chinese-carrier-sails-between-okinawa-islands-for-second-time-in-april-1.627782\n\nTo this the US is caught in a similar position of needing to posture. With both it's carrier groups out of action and significant media attention has been devoted to the navys denials and  mishandling of the crisis, not responding in force would cause it to lose face internationally to it's allies as well as domestically as anti China attacks to distract from domestic mishandling of the pandemic has become national policy. \n\nThese acts are as of now somewhat small potatoes and restrained and measured responses that the US will escalate going into the summer. To me everything will depend on how the US and its allies conducts (or doesn't) RIMPAC, one of the largest naval exercises in the world planned for the summer. \n\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2020/03/as-the-coronavirus-spreads-rimpac-planners-face-grim-facts/\n\nFailure to put on a show that vastly outclasses China and reaffirms American dominance in the Pacific is likely an unacceptable loss of face for the US given the timing and need to project outward military strength during internal turmoil. Regardless of American opinion allied militaries will be less willing to participate in the same size as prior years and the US may need to compensate for that with esclative acts such as inviting Taiwan observers or holding the exercises closer to the South China Sea. To me this parallels the Chinese acts as low cost low risk propaganda victories that it can pursue in the region. \n\nHopefully as long as both sides understand that the posturing is more for domestic audiences rather than real desires to change the status quo tensions will likely ease post RIMPAC in the summer and the restoration of American fleet capacity.",

        "body": " \n\nThere has not been a change in the military balance of power in that theatre in the Corona time frame.\n\nFirst  of all the virus has not, likely, been severe enough to impact  operational sustainability and durability for the involved parties. The United States has one carrier out of \"commission\" due to the virus but  this is under conditions of peace. Had the United States been at war,  warlike condition or elevated preparedness in anticipation of possible  conflict the ship and its escort, battle group, would have sailed promptly.\n\nSecond  the mid to long term balance of power aspects will not develop for  years and will, under ceteris paribus, only materialise if there is a  discrepancy between the economy recovery, hence ability to sustain  operations, between the actors. And/or a shift in priorities. Both which  is unlikely at present; and impossible in the short term.\n\nThird not enough time has elapsed to allow for major shifts in balance of power.\n\nThis  is not to say there might not be dangers accruing from the Corona  pandemic. There might be a danger of the actors over/under-estimating  their and their opponents intent and commitment to their stratagem,  doctrine and foreign policy. The danger lies in misunderstanding each  other; which can increase in troubled times.\n\nA  further element is the possibility of perceiving the other party as  weak, under and after Corona, and thus the opportunity cost of \"bold\"  policies decrease. Inversely the risk, albeit low, of overstepping into  dangerous territory increases.\n\nAdd  to this the plausible scenario where China is put under increasing  pressure, possibly punishing efforts, for letting the Gini out of the  bottle -rightly or wrongly- and a demand/desire in the United States and  possibly Europe for redress. If we see this in the light of the  increased Chinese assertiveness, nationalism, unfair economic  competition, unpredictability and perceived decrease as a trusted  partner relations can easily take a turn to the worse.\n\nTo  the extent it is perceived that China has to be punished. Here we enter  danger territory. The problem for China though is that the United  States and Europe/EU undoubtedly can cause significant hardship for  China. In particular economic hardship; which can lead to stability  issues.\n\nThe three actors account for roughly 62% [(IMF 2019 staff estimates)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=57&pr.y=17&sy=2019&ey=2019&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512%2C668%2C914%2C672%2C612%2C946%2C614%2C137%2C311%2C546%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C314%2C548%2C193%2C556%2C122%2C678%2C912%2C181%2C313%2C867%2C419%2C682%2C513%2C684%2C316%2C273%2C913%2C868%2C124%2C921%2C339%2C948%2C638%2C943%2C514%2C686%2C218%2C688%2C963%2C518%2C616%2C728%2C223%2C836%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C962%2C156%2C142%2C626%2C449%2C628%2C564%2C228%2C565%2C924%2C283%2C233%2C853%2C632%2C288%2C636%2C293%2C634%2C566%2C238%2C964%2C662%2C182%2C960%2C359%2C423%2C453%2C935%2C968%2C128%2C922%2C611%2C714%2C321%2C862%2C243%2C135%2C248%2C716%2C469%2C456%2C253%2C722%2C642%2C942%2C643%2C718%2C939%2C724%2C734%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C726%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C144%2C336%2C146%2C263%2C463%2C268%2C528%2C532%2C923%2C944%2C738%2C176%2C578%2C534%2C537%2C536%2C742%2C429%2C866%2C433%2C369%2C178%2C744%2C436%2C186%2C136%2C925%2C343%2C869%2C158%2C746%2C439%2C926%2C916%2C466%2C664%2C112%2C826%2C111%2C542%2C298%2C967%2C927%2C443%2C846%2C917%2C299%2C544%2C582%2C941%2C474%2C446%2C754%2C666%2C698&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a=) of the world economy and if two -US and EU 46%- and other friends  take on China it will hurt China much more than it will hurt \"the West  and friends\". Though nobody will be unscathed. A problem for China is  the immaturity of the domestic market and its export oriented economy.  That could get ugly.\n\nThe balance of power has not changed in either military and economic terms. Time will tell what kind of change will come.\n\nThe  assertion that China's inevitable rise is something that has to be  endured seems to me to be, to an extent, optimistic, and if they cannot  continuously bring its population out of poverty and into consumerism  the stability of the party, leadership and organisational principle  might be at severe risk. That would affect the balance of power; but not in the short term.",

He sees the US-Australia operation as a signal to Southeast Asian countries that \"no matter how the pandemic develops, the US is still Big Brother in the region\" and was aimed at warning China that \"the pandemic will not give you any opportunity to change the current balance of power [in the region].\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA former deputy minister of Taiwan didn't mention the pandmic, and said the US presence \"has been a response to increased [PRC] 'far sea navigation training'\" and that it aimed to reassure allies of commitment to the region. A former US defence official said that China has become \"more assertive and uncompromising\" towards the rest of the world, under Xi, and that this increased assertiveness puts its diplomatic and defence policies at higher risk. At the same time, he said that \"The pandemic does not fundamentally change the military or strategic balance across the Taiwan Strait but it potentially increases the possiblity of miscalculation if Beijing thinks its handling of the pandemic gives it a military advantage.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe article then notes that one of China's theatre command published four \"belligerent\" articles last week urging the military to increase combat readiness in light of internal and external threats. Meanwhile, analysis from Beijing's Taiwan Affair's Office this month showed an increased support for unification by force, as retired generals believe that the US would not go to war over the island nation. A Singaporean scholar called this assumption risky as \"US credibility is at stake if it's shown to be unwilling to defend its allies\", and that the island is a crucial part of its strategy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe article ends by quoting a former US military chief of staff saying that the US needs to to pre-empt a military conflict, stemming from miscalculations due to the pandemic, by reaching out and explaining Washington's intentions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDespite my unfamiliarity with military affairs (especially compared to those who frequent this sub), it does not seem to me as though the incidents being reported in this article amount to a significant departure from what has been occuring over the last few years (maybe even decades)--Freedom of Navigation operations by the US Navy going through the Strait of Taiwan and challenging the Nine Dash Line claim, joint exercises with allied nations, etc. It's just that the justifications and explanations given have changed. \n\nBut since I'm unfamiliar with this, please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThe ostensible point of the article is that the Wuhan Virus has introduced some space for miscalculations from all sides, and that this can balloon into conflict.\n\nHowever, what's interesting to me is that it shows that the hawkish faction of China's military appears to be growing louder (and perhaps more influential and powerful) because of how the pandemic has increased internal and external threats. As I noted in the previous article, this event seems to be supercharging the nationalists and the hawks (by number or by loudness? I have no idea), and might result in China's internal nationalistic narrative running amok and leading to previously improbable decisions being made.\n\nThis might be the start of a dangerous time for Taiwan in particular--it seems to be under significantly increased risk of invasion as it grows further apart from China, having recently experienced a landslide election victory for the anti-reunification party and an increased closeness with the US that seems to be due to the pandemic (maybe the article was actually referring to the election).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Edit: Clarity*",

All they\u2019d lose is multiparty democracy, but who cares about that?\n\nThe problem is, this conclusion flies in the face of even the most basic understanding of human intelligence (HUMINT) operations and blatantly conflicts with facts on the ground. No intelligence agency is stupid enough to conduct major infiltrations using people who can\u2019t blend in with the locals, and who are so obviously foreign. When the Japanese pulled off the intelligence coup of the century, stealing British dispositions in the Malaya campaign that enabled a quick victory, they didn\u2019t do it through an Asian man, but a New Zealander named Patrick Heenan. If the CCP was so idiotic as to use someone they have known financial relations with (MP Dastyari), or worse, 1st generation Chinese immgrants to conduct espionage on the level of an \u201cexistential threat to Australia\u201d, then all Australians can rest assured that their enemy is too stupid to do any damage.\n\nThe fact is, Chinese espionage and influence in SouthEast and East Asia is far more extensive and widespread than it is in Australia, in spite of the autocratic systems of government which OP praises for their \u201charsh measures\u201d. In Singapore, the entire SingHealth database was stolen by Chinese hackers in 2018. In Cambodia, a country with a history of ruthless persecution of the Chinese minority, China successfully hacked and sabotaged the 2018 Cambodian election. In North Korea, China incited Administration Department chief Jang Song Taek to revolt against his nephew, Kim Jong Un in a country with no Chinese immigrants. This led to armed clashes between military units. All these activities involved no first generation Chinese immigrants for obvious reasons.\n\nThe conclusion of this post is:\n\n> With regards to Australia not being \"Asian\", well it isn't and luckily for China it isn't, because Asian countries aren't open immigrant societies nor would they tolerate the level of interference in their internal affairs. that Australia has received.\n\nOP is basically saying that Chinese immigration is a prerequisite to Chinese espionage. Kim Jong Un will be delighted to hear it.",

Australia's experience with ethnic Chinese politicians is shallower than Canada's, and a rotten candidate doesn't do any good for either Australia, Chinese Australia and even China.\n\n# HOW DO ASIAN COUNTRIES RESPOND TO CHINESE INTERFERENCE\n\nMost Asian countries don't have Chinese interference problem, because they had adopted harsh measures in 1950-70s when China support Communist in their countries. These policies were driven by racism as well as a fear of Chinese influence. Since the end of the Cold War, these policies have been abandoned, but the paranoia exist. In East Asia and Southeast Asia they avoid problems of Chinese interference largely by not accepting large number of  new Chinese immigrants since 1949,.\n\nIn this section I will focus my attention on Singapore, because it is the only country in Asia that has accepted a large number of Mainland Chinese migrants legally, Like in the US, most foreign born politicians came to Singapore as children. There are no China born in MP in the Singaporean parliament, despite Mainland Chinese immigrants numbering in the hundred of thousands. Singaporean society is a stratified society that requires building social capital early.. To become MP, it usually means you have entered university (local or oversea) on a government scholarship, that requires getting into right feeder schools. For men, there is also the requirement you have to served in Singapore Armed Forces. There is no chance someone like Gladys Liu becoming MP in Singapore. You add on top of this,[ prejudice toward Mainland Chinese. Its bad enough, many Mainland Chinese consider Singapore a stepping stone to the immigration to the West](https://radiichina.com/in-singapore-immigrants-and-locals-clash-over-chinese-identity/).\n\nSingapore is not politically correct. Malays are banned from certain professions in the Singaporean Armed Forces\n\nWhat [ Bilahari Kausikan](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporeans-should-be-aware-of-chinas-influence-ops-bilahari) spoken about before was influencing through the media, but Singapore is very strict about foreign individuals trying to influence and interfere in its domestic politics, as was the case with [Huang Jing's case in 2017](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2106497/what-singapore-saying-expelling-china-hand-huang-jing) and [American diplomat  E. Mason Hendrickson in 1988](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2106497/what-singapore-saying-expelling-china-hand-huang-jing)\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nWith regards to Australia not being \"Asian\", well it isn't and luckily for China it isn't, because Asian countries aren't open immigrant societies nor would they tolerate the level of interference in their internal affairs. that Australia has received.\n\nAustralia-China relations is more complicated than many people assume, because of domestic interference and influencing issues. If China intensifies its interference and influencing operations, and I think it will,  relations with Australia will only get worse regardless of the economic ties.",

        "body": "I'll give some context to the ***Philippines v. China case (2016)***, we have to differentiate between different things and clarify what the ruling actually said.\n\n>China's territorial claims in the South China Sea extend from Hong Kong down to Brunei, and from Vietnam to Manila from west to east. In other words, China claims the entire sea.\n\n*Territorial claims* and *maritime claims* are not the same. China (Both the PRC and ROC) claims historical rights *both* in terms of territorial rights, and in terms of maritime rights as an exemption to the UNCLOS rules under the nine dash line. Alternatively, they also claim maritime rights under the UNCLOS as a result of their territorial claims. The distinction between these is very important, as i will illustrate soon.\n\nThe UNCLOS does *not* regulate territorial claims, it regulates what maritime claims can be made *on the basis of territorial ownership*. To illustrate it shortly: You get your \"internal waters\", you get 12 NM \"territorial waters\" with full sovereignty and 200 NM of \"economic zone\" with mostly sovereingty over resource exploitation.\n\nAll landmass give rise to the 12 NM territorial sovereignty, also so called \"rocks\" (islands that are too small to legally be islands). To get the 200 NM economic zones, you need to legally be an islands.\n\n>In fact, Vietnam, the Philippines and others have lodged complaints about China's violation of UNCLOS, and in 2016, the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines ruling that China has \"no historical rights\" based on the \"nine-dash line\" map.\n\nBecause of the above distinction, this is quite inaccurate. I'll go through the most important rulings.\n\n*(1) \"Historical rights\" to maritime claims*\n\nThe most famous part of the ruling is that Chinas \"historical rights\" give it no *maritime rights* beyond what the UNCLOS convention normally allows. That means that any rights in the SCS has to be based on 12 NM \"territorial waters\" or 200 NM EEZs from its *territorial rights* in the SCS. Important to note here is that the court ***did not rule on \"historical rights\" to territorial claims.*** China still has a territorial claim to the Spratleys that has not been ruled on.\n\nIt's worth noting that China immediately rejected this ruling, but that doesn't remove the legal power of the judgement.\n\n*(2) Status of the Spratley islands as \"Rocks\"*\n\nAs said above, the importance of being a \"rock\" or \"island\" is whether you have just a 12 NM territorial zone or also a 200 NM EEZ. The Court rules that not even Taiping Islands (the largest of the Spratleys, \"owned\" by Taiwan) could be considered an \"island\". That means all of the Spratleys can only give the claimant legally 12 NM of control as \"territorial water\".\n\n*(3) Some features are only \"low tide features\"*\n\n\"Low-tide features\" don't constitute \"rocks\" and thus can't be territorally claimed, and don't give the 12 NM territorial zone. The court ruled that for example Mischief reef and Second Thomas shoal don't constitute rocks. This means they aren't territories, but just features of the continental shelf, which in this instance is the Philippines continental shelf, and can't be claimed by China.\n\nThe court also ruled on other matters, like economic exploitation disagreements, fishing, etc. But these three are the central ones.\n\n*(4) Consequenses and situation after the ruling*\n\nThe result of the ruling is that China can still (if we assume the ruling to be good law) claim territorial rights under the nine dash line, if those have any legal merit, and can claim 12 NM territorial waters from it's \"rocks\", but can claim no EEZ in the whole nine-dash line and no EEZ from the rocks. Some of the areas it claims, however, don't constitute \"rocks\" either.\n\nThis means the \"rocks\" essentially become strategic outposts that give a small area of high strategic control (a country has large sovereingty in its territorial waters), rather than economic assets providing wide economic control. But there are quite many of these rocks in the spartleys, so ownership of a lot can still give a \"patchwork\" of territorial zones that could cover a moderate area.\n\nOf course the court didn't rule on Chinas other conflicts, like maritime and territorial disagreements with Vietnam. Taiping island in the Spratleys (which is a rock, not an island) is 1.4km\\^2 and has 250 inhabitants, mostly military. The largest island in the Parcels is Woody island with 2.1 km\\^2 and 1000 inhabitants. Woody island has a history of sustaining human population (the requirement to be an island) and with an actual city, it's seems quite likely that this would be considered an island.\n\nThus, Woody island (and the parcels as such) now probably have more legal importance than the Spratleys, seeing as they can give both 12 NM territorial waters and 200 NM EEZs, making them a strategic *and* economic asset.\n\n*(5)* *Great powers ignoring international court rulings*\n\nAnd lastly it's hard for the US to argue moral superiority in this instance, being a non-signatory to the UNCLOS. China is a party to the UNCLOS unlike the US, despite claiming historical exemption from parts of it. The US also, like China, refused to even meet or acknowledge the case of a minor country versus it in *USA v. Nicaragua*, not to mention it's sabotaging of the WTO appelate body. The US also executed a german national despite the ICJ saying it was against international law in the *LaGrand* case and it's later compliance has been mixed. Bush also decided that the US would not comply with the *Avena* case not too long after that ruling.\n\nSo China ignoring a ruling by an international court is extremely unfortunate for smaller countries, but nothing unique from major global powers.",

There's a difference, the difference is China is not the only nation that lost out, even Taiwan lost out on its claim of island status for its rock. \n\nSo if China lost then all the US allies lost. \n\nWith China having the strongest navy in the area by far and the biggest coast guard in the world, China still wins by default. Though this is a matter of opinion, one can see it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Pentagon officials have all said they expect South China Sea to be one  of the most important theaters for the US military in the near future \n\nI believe that, but due to Taiwan, China has always taken the entire US navy as its target anyways, regardless of this.

That is the same as me choosing to support the Bucs because Brady went there, not a bad thing, but not a useful thing either. \n\nThe Philippines, once the second richest in Asia has squandered its position and has a navy even worse than one of China's coast guard branches. Yes I checked, but I encourage others to confirm as well.\n\nVietnam is taking the China approach in that economic development takes precedent, and naval warfare is unlike land. Guerrilla tactics are ineffective at best even when it is equal. It's suicidal when the technological gap is this much. \n\nIndonesia? Really not much better. 2 modern frigates and 4 modern corvettes, relatively. China launches more in a year than that. Literally. Type 054 and 056. \n\nSo it's just the US and China, which would be on either way and this doesn't change that.",

        "body": ">So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia\u2019s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia\u2019s hegemony in the region.\n\nFirst, Russian town on the Russia-Chinese border are small to begin with.  Here are the populations of towns with railway crossings.  Zabaykalsk has a population of 13,000. [Grodekovo](https://www.city-facts.com/grodekovo-anuchinsky-district-far-eastern-federal-district-russia) population is 25,000 and Makhalino is 2700. Out of the three cities, only say a population increase from 11000 in 2000 to 13000 now. The two others have saw population declines of about 20-30% over the last 20 years. While Chinese border towns have saw population increases, the same could not be said of the region as a whole\n\nBoth Russian Far East and China's bordering provinces saw population declines, with China's NE province suffering the more. Here is an excerpt from a comment I did five months ago\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/oz81t5/comment/h7ztl0p/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/oz81t5/comment/h7ztl0p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>First, much of China's provinces bordering Russia, are themselves facing depopulation. People are migrating to the South, just like is happening in Siberia. Here is an excerpt of how serious the problem is in the Northeast\r  \n\r  \nThe 2020 population census has revealed, however, that those numbers were completely wrong. According to the results, the three northeastern provinces have actually seen their combined population decline by 11 million people, or roughly 10%, since the 2010 census. The chart below shows the difference between the population numbers that have been published annually for the previous decade, and the trend implied by the 2020 census. The dotted lines are a simple linear extrapolations between the 2010 and 2020 census data points, so they assume the population decline began in 2010. If instead more of the population decline happened after 2014-15, which seems plausible, then the downward slope of the lines would be even steeper. In either case, population trends have clearly changed dramatically over the past decade.\r  \n\r  \nThe population has declined by 12% in the last decade. In contrast Siberia's population has decline by 2 million from 35 Million in the last 20 years.\n\nThe Russian Far East has experience far less population decline than China's Northeastern provinces, largely due to lower regional differences in growth rates in Russia. The reality is Russia isn't threatened by China in Siberia, because China's population is moving southward.",

I could see investments in beefing up supply lines/ creating new rail infrastructureand increased naval investment, but Russia\u2019s western flank has and will continue to be one of the most important. From a geographical perspective, the borders of Russia in the east, north and south run up against barriers or countries with not bad relations (ocean, buffer states/ states with Russian influence,China). The western flank has been the route of a number of invasions (as well as its most populous and industrialized regions) and as a result tends to be most prioritized (napoleon, hitler). This imo is one of the reasons the ussr significantly expanded its influence over Eastern Europe post ww2. keeping friendly states to the ussr on its borders would ideally prevent any further invasion. I think the focus will remain in the west for the given time, but as the northern ports and shipping lanes become more viable, the strategic significance of northern Russia will skyrocket. Already Russia has one of the largest military presences in the Arctic circle. As for the Black Sea, if the Turks allow nato warships to pass through the new strait being built, Russo Turkish relations would plummet, and I would not be surprised if Russia attempts to coerce turkey either militarily or diplomatically to deny nato warships access.

I think they would rather stay focused on NK, but if there is an opportunity to enter a broader and more robust self-defense treaty... you better believe they'll grab the opportunity.  Anything that pulls the U.S. closer, and gets other partners involved in their defense, is a win for them.\n\n4)  Philippines - probably the biggest prize on the \"possible\" list, the Philippines are the most western-oriented of ASEAN and the one most directly threatened by the South China Sea artificial island construction.  The Spratleys are less than 100 miles from Palawan.  One joint base on Palawan would be a HUGE strategic deterrent to China - the Quad may be willing to offer significant concessions to the Philippines to secure their partnership.  Or just try to reactivate Subic Bay (which I'm sure the U.S. regrets leaving now!).  On the other side, they're part of ASEAN, which increasingly looks like the economic groundwork for an eventual counter-coalition.  I think the Philippines are a toss up, probably leaning towards non-alignment.\n\n5)  Taiwan - desire for partnership is obvious, but recognition as a member also implies recognition as an independent country.  Would be a huge escalation on the diplomatic side.\n\n6)  Vietnam - let's be clear, this is unlikely.  I could see the Quad trying, if only to force China to cover their flank.  Allowing a neighboring country, in ASEAN, with perfect geography for guerilla style resistance and missile bases that could control the South China Sea... to be part of an enemy alliance... China simply cannot allow it.  Quad will attempt to make this happen if only to poke a stick in China's eye.  Keeping Vietnam out of hostile alliance is a hill China will die on.",

Although not explicitly stated (AFAIK), these founding principles very strongly imply that a country's border should be respected. One of the founding principles is to refrain from using force. \n\nIn 1945,  the US was basically the biggest and most un-destroyed economy in the world. Its navy and armed forces had no rivals. Many countries had suffered in the war and needed time to rebuild. By the time the Cold War began, ideological rivalries became fixed and basically it became rather difficult to conquer countries without one of the big powers stepping in. \n\nThe war basically signaled the end of colonial empires and by the 1970s nearly all major colonies were granted or won independence. To vastly oversimplify, if you were friendly with the West - the US guarded your borders from conquest and if you were friendly with the USSR, the USSR guarded your borders. (This is vastly oversimplified). \n\nOf course there was still the Korean war, Vietnam war and various others but until 1991, many borders were more or less fixed by great power rivalry. Bangladesh split from Pakistan in 1971, Singapore joined Malaysia then left Malaysia and became an independent nation. Pakistan and India still don't agree on borders of J&K. India and China have disputed borders. Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s. South Sudan in the 2000s. Morocco has annexed Western Sahara. Eritrea broke away from Ethiopia. And Russia has \"sponsored\" a number of enclave \"autonomous zones\" that are neither here nor there as countries. Somaliland is kinda sorta independent from Somalia.

        "body": "Telegraph (Sophia Yan):\n\n> A Uyghur militant group that helped to topple Bashar-al Assad has vowed to take the fight to China.\nThe Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) threatened Beijing in a video released on Dec 8, the day the Syrian regime collapsed, showing its fighters holding machine guns and wearing military fatigues.\n\n> \u201cNow here in Syria, in all the cities here, we fight for Allah, and we will continue to do this in our Urumchi, Aqsu and Kashgar in the future,\u201d said one masked man, listing cities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, from where the Uyghurs hail. \u201cWe will chase the Chinese infidels away.\u201d\n\n> Using the Uyghurs\u2019 preferred name for their homeland, he added: \u201cWe have fought in Homs, in Idlib and we will continue the fight in East Turkistan.\n\n> \u201cAllah has given us a victory here. May he also grant us a victory in our own land.\u201d\n\n> The TIP has been based in Syria for more than a decade, with its members fleeing to the Middle East to escape China\u2019s severe oppression of the Uyghurs, a largely Muslim minority group. Its fighters joined Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive, in a thrust out of the north-west of Syria.\n\n> In recent days TIP has engaged in an unusual publicity blitz, showcasing its leader Abu Muhammed alongside his battalions.\n\n> One video claims to show the TIP fighting against Assad\u2019s forces on the front lines in late November 2024, shortly after the rebel offensive was launched. Another shows TIP fighters rolling into Damascus on tanks, waving light blue flags bearing the group\u2019s crescent-and-star symbol.\n\n> According to the video captions, TIP fighters entered the strategic port cities of Latakia and Tartus on Dec 10 and 11. Both are situated along Syria\u2019s coastline and previously hosted Russian forces.\n\u201cSo many groups allied against us. Russia came, Iran came, Hezbollah came \u2013 with strong weapons and all kinds of soldiers,\u201d said one man in the Dec 8 video. \u201cBut each time, Allah as our witness, we did not retreat.\n\n> \u201cWith the help of Allah, we have fought our way here. We did not once show weakness or fear; we were never afraid.\u201d\n\n> TIP certainly had a role to play in the rebel victory, said Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, an independent researcher who specialises in the Syrian civil war.\n\n> \u201cThey weren\u2019t necessarily a larger force than the other Syrian insurgent groups that were assisting HTS, but they were part of the offensive,\u201d he said.\n\n> In 2021, Syrian television reportedly described the group as HTS\u2019s \u201cfavourite ally\u201d. TIP senior leadership have also indicated previously that the group was glad to support their \u201cSyrian brothers\u2019 demand that the Assad regime leaves\u201d.\nTIP has stayed in Syria during 13 years of civil war and appears to have retained an independent identity despite ties to other factions.\n\n> The group, established some time in the 1990s with a previous presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has continually highlighted its priority as Uyghur independence, describing a goal to \u201cliberate the Muslims of East Turkistan from the Chinese occupation\u201d.\n\n> On Dec 6, as the Syrian rebel offensive pushed onward, TIP\u2019s emir, Abd Haq al-Turkistani, released a statement stressing the group\u2019s plans to attack China in the future.\n\n> \u201cWhile the Muslims are celebrating these victories in every place, the Muslims of oppressed East Turkistan remain far removed from the news of them as they live under a filthy oppressive, disbelieving occupation that suppresses them by every means possible,\u201d he said.\n\n> \u201cThrough God\u2019s support, the Chinese disbelievers will soon taste the same torment that the disbelievers in al-Sham have tasted, if God wills.\"\n\n> The group has posted pictures on social media of blood splattering the face of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.\n\n> Other clips highlight grievances such as the 1990 Baren Uprising, when possibly thousands of Uyghur protesters were killed by the Chinese government, a massacre that was later whitewashed by the authorities. The real number of fatalities is unknown.\n\n> Rune Steenberg, an anthropologist who specialises in the Uyghurs at Palacky University Olomouc, said: \u201cThey see this as one step of a global jihad, where one day all Muslims will be free, and part of that will be the Muslims in East Turkistan. They\u2019re saying, \u2018Now we are guests, but with God\u2019s help, we will soon be hosts.\u2019\u201d\n\n> China\u2019s crackdown on the Uyghurs has seen more than one million people forced into re-education camps, with thousands more imprisoned for \u201ccrimes\u201d such as praying or fasting.\n\n> In interviews with The Telegraph, former detainees have described being beaten in solitary confinement and made to pledge loyalty to Mr Xi.\n\n> Many chose to flee China by paying thousands of dollars to smugglers. Some hoped to go abroad to learn more about their own religion of Islam, the independent practice of which is banned by the government. Only state-sanctioned Qurans and state-controlled imams are allowed.\n\n> Whether TIP can materially organise and launch attacks against the Chinese government remains to be seen.\n\n> Beijing has long emphasised and perhaps overstated TIP\u2019s strength as a pretext to justify its crackdown on the Uyghurs, while some Uyghur experts have debated how cohesive the group really is, saying that it\u2019s virtually non-existent.\n\n> While TIP\u2019s latest propaganda \u2013 set to a score of sweeping music \u2013 indicates that it does indeed exist and is active, it remains unclear what their full capabilities are in terms of numbers, training and firepower.\n\n> China boasts the world\u2019s largest military at two million strong, and has advanced weapons systems and armed drones.\nBut the country\u2019s growing overseas investments \u2013 a cornerstone of Xi\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 means there are infrastructure assets and an influx of Chinese workers internationally that could be at risk of attack.\n\n> China is very likely to request the extradition of TIP members, a group it considers a terrorist organisation.\n\n> Its presence in Syria \u201cwill definitely be a sticking point if the new Syrian government wants a relationship with China\u201d, said Mr Jawad al-Tamimi, adding: \u201cBut if HTS hands them over, it\u2019s a big compromise of one of their principles.\u201d\n\n> One of HTS\u2019s founding principles, he said, was that the foreigners who joined the Syrian insurgency had to be protected. In exchange, they had to promise not to use Syria as a launching pad for terrorist attacks abroad.\n\n> In 2020, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of HTS, said: \u201cThese guys have been in Syria for seven years and have never constituted a threat to the outside world.\n\u201cThey are committed solely to defending Idlib against regime aggression.\n\n> \u201cAs Uyghurs, they face persecution in China \u2013 which we strongly condemn \u2013 and they have nowhere else to go. Of course, I sympathise with them, but their struggle in China is not ours, so we tell them that they are welcome here as long as they abide by our rules \u2013 which they do.\u201d\n\n> There is also a question of how much influence TIP will have as al-Jolani and other armed groups set up a new governing system in Damascus, said Broderick McDonald, an associate fellow at King\u2019s College London\u2019s international centre for the study of radicalisation.\n\n> For the Uyghurs and other foreign fighters now stepping out of the shadows [in propaganda videos] as they feel more secure, what does that mean for what they do with minority groups, and will they try to shape the future of Syria?\n\n> There is a chance that a more hardline faction could splinter off, but for now, TIP propaganda indicates the group is grateful for their gracious host in Syria.\n\n> In one video from Dec 10, a masked fighter addressed a congregation at what the group says was a mosque in Latakia.\n\n> \u201cThe Chinese government drove us out of our country, oppressed us, killed us and imprisoned us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe left our country and came here \u2026 we have seen from you all the goodness for the past 10 years. We are the mujahideen of East Turkistan.\u201d",

        "body": "If China starts a war it would bear a resemblance to Russia.  Part of why Putin decided to invade is because he knew Russia's demographic profile was on the decline.  The population is falling, and the portion of young people even more so.  So part of why he struck now is because waiting would likely only make it even more difficult in the future.\n\nLikewise, China is experiencing a similar demographic problem.  Their huge pool of cheap labor is beginning to age out of the workforce, leaving behind a smaller group of young workers who are demanding higher wages.  China's labor is quickly losing it's greatest advantage, its  low cost.  \n\nPerhaps Xi is worried about the same thing Putin was.  If this is the zenith of Chinese power, he may never get a better opportunity to make a move.  What still remains to be seen is if there is any move that can succeed.  Russia is seeing now that the west is far from weak.  The sheer scale of the arms and finance the west can bring to bear is crippling him in the hands of Ukrainian fighters.  And this doesn't even include state-of-the-art systems.  China's niche as the world's factory is evaporating, and Xi likely fears that sanctions against his own country will become more and more plausible as global reliance on Chinese goods wanes.  But does he take the gamble?  Strike now and risk accelerating the decline of his nation?",

Like every president, he is going to be controlled/influenced by corporations; in this case; the big tech lobby that jumped on the conservative bandwagon. This group NEEDS Taiwan. Taiwan is also significantly.smarter as a country than Ukraine from a foreign policy standpoint. They understand the rammifications of their situation and effectively have kill switches in their factories if a full invasion does occur rendering a Chinese invasion useless. Taiwan has much more control of their own situation as Ukraine does. Even waging an invasion from the Chinese perspective is drastically more complex and challenging \n\nChina is trying to shift the balance of power in any way if can hence investing in military and navy but I doubt an attack is imminent ( next 4 yrs ).because Taiwan itself has acted intelligently diplomatically.\n\nUkraine is essentially beholden to American interests. It's economic assets to Americans are essentially 0. The tech industry /lobby doesn't care much about Ukraine. The defense industry does as well as foreign policy think tanks but trump will likely elect to ignore them.\n\nUkraine does not equal Taiwan does not equal Iran /Israel (may as well include them ) . I suspect trump will be more active in supporting Israel (not like Biden did much but trump will likely still ship weapons and expand defense deals) , about the same with Taiwan ( go look at American quad expenditure under Trump's first term. It still increased annually....a pretty good indicator of what's going to happen ) and Ukraine support will decrease significantly ( you all already speculated. Popular position among the Republican base as well)",

Trump will bring back those Tariffs, tensions with China will rise but i don't think they will blow up. \n\nRussia, Trump is basically going to hand Russia all the territory they have occupied in Ukraine. The choice Trump is going to give Ukraine is this: you either agree to these peace terms or we  stop supplying you with weapons and Russia can do whatever the fuck the want. \n\nGaza....might as well not exist now, Trump relies heavily on a evangelical vote, very pro-Zionist and as a result he's not going to stop Israel basically taking it.  \n\nIts going to get very rough but I do think that the economics of our world today means it can only get so bad. The west has shifted  from capitalism to corporatism and corporate's like nice stable markets and money wars fuck that right up.",

Even if they can likely outfight them with conventional weapons, the \"axis of resistance\" has nukes to fall back on. If they had their own nukes, Germany/South Korea/Japan could deter them from using their nukes; without them, increasing their safety from retaliatory strikes. \n\nThe more they doubt the US will defend its allies, the more they will want to increase their safety by developing their own weaponry.\n\nThis seems likely to encourage the non-nuclear advanced democracies to quietly develop nuclear weaponry, thus increasing proliferation and the overall risk of a nuclear exchange.",

I wouldn't be able to vote on a party that would support a foreign policy of the EU moving closer to China before Trump. Now, I'm not sure.\n\nUkraine is of massive importance to the EU, Trump is planning on materializing the worst-case scenario for the EU by forcing Ukraine to give land to Russia and keeping them out of future defensive securities. Russia is the EU's priority rival. Trump wants to start a trade war with the EU **and** force a rift between the EU and the UK. Trump wants to support Israel to the max, which will thus continue to destabilize the Middle East. On top of that, Trump's threat about not defending NATO countries has had deep impact in the European powers. Sure, European powers are now spending more cash on defenses, they also *don't trust Trump* anymore. And oh yeah, also, Trump wants the EU to take a hard stance against China because *that benefits the US*. \n\nSo... if Trump wants to do all those things that hurt the EU... why not get closer to China? If the EU gets closer to China, they might choose us over Russia and the EU could weaken the Russians in that way. If the EU gets closer to China, they might be able to fill up the trade problems the US will create the next 4 years with Trump. Trump has already implied that he wouldn't want to defend NATO countries, and now that he is going to drop Ukraine *it's not just a threat that Trump is dangerous for European geopolitical interestsm.* It's already reality. So it's not like Trump/the US has the leverage of 'do what we say or we won't protect you anymore' because they've already started doing that. \n\nI still hate China, but it does seem like they're becoming the more realistic and practical partner than the US. Defeating the Russians would be in the interests of the US, too, yet they seem willing to cut off both your noses to spite their own face. How can the EU work with the US, when the US is hellbend on screwing us *and themselves?* \n\nI'm not friends with a suicide bomber for a reason. Risky business, and it ain't worth it..",

He doesn't understand cost benefit analysis, because he always took steps to cheat out of the costs when it suited him by stiffing his business connections.\n\nIt's a simple what-if game here, and he's not bothering to play it through to the end. What happens if China invades Taiwan? TSMC *would not survive*. It would be a series of smoking craters, either through the necessities of war, or through the US refusing to let the facilities fall into the PRC's hands.\n\nWhat happens if TSMC is obliterated? The entire US tech industry collapses. The likely result is that China fills the gap and ascends to technological superiority in the next 30 years.\n\nInstead of worrying about the ROC paying us for defense, he should be worrying about building up US capacity for high end chip manufacturing, to decrease TSMC's strategic value and remove a single point of failure that isn't even within US borders.\n\nYou know, like Biden is doing?

It's a long read and heavy on the technical side while light on the political commentary compared to The Atlantic piece. \n\nSome Interesting observation and comparison. The Atlantic piece wrote:\n>China may never match, let alone surpass, the United States in chips. By the time Chinese companies reach one goal, their foreign competitors have moved further ahead. \u201cThat\u2019s constantly a struggle that any latecomer has to deal with,\u201d Rand\u2019s Goodrich told me. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to close the gap, but the gap is constantly moving forward.\n\n>\"Ten years ago, they were two generations behind. Five years ago, they were two generations behind, and now they\u2019re still two generations behind,\u201d G. Dan Hutcheson, the vice-chair of the research firm TechInsights, told me. \u201cThe harder they run, they just stay in place.\u201d\n\nWhile on the rare political insight of the American Affairs article wrote:\n\n>The \u201cSulli\u00advan Doctrine,\u201d as articulated in late 2022, includes several parts, starting with Sullivan\u2019s assertion that the United States intends to maintain an **absolute lead** over China in key sectors, rather than a **sliding scale**.\n\nThe Atlantic Piece wrote\n\n>In addition, the subsidies have encouraged Chinese companies to build factories that manufacture legacy chips, using older technology, and has led to fears that China could flood the global market, leading Biden to announce in May that the U.S. will double the tariff on imported Chinese semiconductors from 25 to 50 percent by next year.\n\nIirc, China accounts to almost half of the world chips demand and much of the demand are on the legacy / mature semiconductor. With the domestic firms taking further and further marketshare many of the foreign firms are increasingly cut off from those important source of revenue.\n\nLastly there is this spicy line on the development of EUV machine\n\n>In addition, work will continue steadily on the various EUV projects, including building up a cadre of engineers, managers, and supply-chain specialists to begin developing sustainable ecosystems for EUV systems development and deployment later in the decade. In the most optimistic scenario, according to some industry watchers, progress on EUV means that SMIC could get its hands on a prototype system to begin testing in 2025, but this scenario is much more optimistic than other industry assessments.55",

Washington\u2019s ban on the export of American advanced microchips and other sanctions designed \u201cto suppress China\u2019s trade and technology development\u201d are \u201ccreating risks.\u201d If Biden \u201cis adamant on containing China\u2019s high-tech development,\u201d the official Chinese readout went on, Beijing \u201cis not going to sit back and watch.\u201d\n\nBiden has been robust in his response. The ban, he told Xi, was necessary to protect American national security. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Biden recently recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018Because you use it for all the wrong reasons, so you\u2019re not going to get those advanced computer chips.\u2019\u201d\n\nImagine for a moment how humiliating that exchange must have been for Xi Jinping. Xi is not supposed to suffer such indignities. His propaganda machine portrays him as an all-knowing sage who will lead China to a new era of global greatness. His word is practically law, and such a warning as he gave Biden would have induced fear and obedience among his compatriots. Yet the American leader not only stood firm; he even went on to lecture the Chinese dictator.\n\nXi is only too aware that the United States stands in the way of his grand ambitions for Chinese hegemony. His desperate desire to break free from American global power motivates much of his policy: his partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his campaign for economic self-reliance, the expansion of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal. As yet, though, China can\u2019t shake off Washington\u2019s sway. China still needs the dollar, American capital, and the U.S. global-security system to sustain its own rise.\n\nAnd perhaps nothing encapsulates Xi\u2019s predicament better than the microchip. Xi needs the smallest and fastest chips to fulfill his dream of transforming China into a technology powerhouse. But China doesn\u2019t make them. Nor does China make the immensely complex equipment needed to manufacture them. For that, Xi must rely on the U.S. and its allies\u2014and their willingness to share the technology.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRead more here: [https://theatln.tc/Oli2t4f1](https://theatln.tc/Oli2t4f1)",

That's a decade old technology now and even then it is inferior to what TSMC, Samsung and Intel did 10 years ago even at those nodes.\n\nHonestly China could have had better chips if they wanted to because it's possible for them to buy Samsung machines and poach talent to try and engineer their own versions.\n\nThe fact that China *doesn't do this* and instead kind of chooses to have worse chips tells me that China honestly doesn't care about the chip war or thinks that it's not relevant/important enough to care about.\n\nThis could indicate a couple of things:\n\n* 1) Chinese leadership is not competent enough to see the importance of chip technology\n\n* 2) China realizes that they will invade and destroy Taiwanese chip technology which would bring the west back about a decade for them to be on par with us anyway so no need to improve on the chip technology front, just focus on volume instead.\n\n* 3) China is right and chips are indeed not important, volume and cost per chip are more important in a large scale WW3 scenario where volume of cheap disposable drones and hardware are more important.\n\nStill surprising how China seems to have just given up on building better chips a couple of years ago as their manufacturing has stagnated from all the chip analysis I've seen.",

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The U.S. doesn\u2019t know if the sub was carrying nuclear fuel at the time it sank, but experts outside the U.S. government said that was likely. \n\n>Undersea technology has long been an area of U.S. advantage, but China has been pushing hard to narrow the gap. \n\n>China has been moving to diversify the production of nuclear-powered submarines. Production has been centered in the northeastern city of Huludao, but China is now moving to manufacture nuclear-powered attack submarines at the Wuchang Shipyard near Wuhan. \n\n>Beijing had 48 diesel-powered attack subs and six nuclear-powered attack subs at the end of 2022, according to a Pentagon report issued last year on China\u2019s military power, \n\n>That report said that China\u2019s aim in developing new attack submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft is to counter efforts by the U.S. and its partners to come to Taiwan\u2019s aid during a conflict and to achieve \u201cmaritime superiority\u201d within the first island chain, a string of territory from the Japanese archipelago through Taiwan and the Philippines to the South China Sea.\n\n>The Zhou-class vessel that sank is the first of a new class of Chinese nuclear-powered subs and features a distinctive X-shaped stern, which is designed to make the vessel more maneuverable. \n\n>The sub was built by China State Shipbuilding Corp., a state-owned company, and was observed alongside a pier on the Yangtze River in late May when it was undergoing its final equipping before going to sea. \n\n>After the sinking, large floating cranes arrived in early June to salvage the sub from the river bed, according to satellite photos of the site.\n \n>\u201cThe sinking of a new nuclear sub that was produced at a new yard will slow China\u2019s plans to grow its nuclear submarine fleet,\u201d said Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank, and a retired U.S. Navy nuclear submarine officer. \u201cThis is significant.\u201d \n\n>Neither the People\u2019s Liberation Army, as the Chinese military is known, nor local authorities, have acknowledged the episode.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pierside,\u201d said a senior U.S. defense official. \u201cIn addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA\u2019s internal accountability and oversight of China\u2019s defense industry, which has long been plagued by corruption.\u201d\n\n>The first public indication that something was amiss at the shipyard near Wuhan came in the summer when Thomas Shugart, a former U.S. submarine officer and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote a series of social-media posts noting the unusual activity of the floating cranes, which was captured by commercial satellite imagery.\n\n>Shugart surmised that there might have been an incident that involved a new type of submarine, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that it was nuclear-powered. \n\n>\u201cCan you imagine a U.S. nuclear submarine sinking in San Diego and the government hushes it up and doesn\u2019t tell anybody about it? I mean, Holy Cow!\u201d Shugart said in an interview this week with The Wall Street Journal.\n\n>While the submarine was salvaged, it will likely take many months before it can be put to sea.\n\n>\u201cThe whole boat would be full of water,\u201d Shugart said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to clean out all the electronics. The electric motors may need to be replaced. It would be a lot of work.\u201d\n\n>American officials haven\u2019t detected any indication that Chinese officials have sampled the water or nearby environment for radiation. It is possible Chinese personnel were killed or injured when the sub sank, but U.S. officials say they don\u2019t know if there were casualties. \n\n>Shugart said that the risk of a nuclear leak was likely to be low as the sub hadn\u2019t ventured out to sea and its reactors were probably not operating at a high power level. \n\n>The U.S. has suffered similar setbacks, which proved costly. In 1969, the nuclear-powered USS Guitarro was moored at a shipyard in California when it sank following a series of mistakes by construction workers. It wasn\u2019t officially commissioned until 32 months after its sinking.",

This is the only way they can keep the economic prize intact.\n\nChina is not really focused on 'reunification'. It's moreso about capturing and looting Taiwan's high tech industry. Those EUV machines alone are worth their weight in gold to China, since they are blocked from acquiring them themselves.\n\nThe moment China can set up and hold a blockade against any retaliatory forces, Taiwan is theirs. This is why China isn't investing in landing craft as much as it is a proper Navy and antiship capabilities. It's also why China is more focused on separating the US from Taiwan. Taiwan is using it's high tech industry as a way to keep the US interested in being a strategic ally. China is focused on removing that interest.\n\nTaiwan's high tech industry is more valuable if left intact. I'm sure Taiwan knows this and has many of it's key buildings rigged to self destruct.",

And both have drunk deep of the Cool-Aid exemplified by the common Chinese trope \u201cthe East is rising, the West is in decline.\u201d \n\nSo now it's 'drinking the cool-aid' to accept the demonstrable reality that the east is rising whilst the west largely stagnates? Something that economic forecasters have been stating as an obvious truth for decades? China literally overtook the US in PPP GDP\n\n> from a strategic perspective, it makes perfect sense for China to remain close to Russia given that under Xi Jinping China\u2019s foreign and security policy is driven by an increasingly zero-sum view of relations with the USA and the West more generally.\n\nI would argue that the zero-sum sentiment is almost entirely coming from the west. Namely 'it's either us or them. If china rises then we're doomed'. There is no innate rule of existence that says you can't have multiple powerful countries living harmoniously, especially within the modern international order.\n\n> The Russian invasion of Ukraine has given rise to the perception that the world is now divided between open societies invested in the rules-based international order versus authoritarian states willing to use armed force to pursue their objective in defiance of international law.\n\nWhat sort of crazy revisionist history false dichotomy is this? You can be authoritarian and peaceable just as you can be an 'open society' and use armed force to pursue your objectives.\n\nAdmittedly that is certainly the 'perception' that is growing in the west, but it doesn't stop it being ridiculous.\n\n> If the US lost control of this island chain, this would fundamentally affect the global balance of power.\n\nThis is considered 'accepted fact', but is it really true?\n\nIf i had a foreign power permanently stationing a navy in my territorial waters i would want them to leave too. It strikes me much more as US paranoia than an obvious truth.\n\nControl of the seas was very much a 19th century british policy that was arguably a necessity of the time to guarantee trade (albeit british trade). Beyond that controlling all the world's oceans doesn't mean a whole lot outside of another world war. Am i missing something? What exactly is it that people think is going to happen? NATO have already claimed all the uninhabited islands throughout the world's oceans anyway.\n\n> China has been disconcerted by successful efforts on the part of the Biden administration to reinvigorate and enhance US alliance structures in the Indo-Pacific region, notably the Quad arrangement linking India, Japan, Australia and the US,\n\nI was under the impression that 'the quad' was largely meaningless no?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the topic of a china-taiwan conflict, the cultural/historic reasoning behind it and how advanced china's miitary actually is i can't recommend this comment chain enough.

Kaplan, published in the New Statesman on January 8, 2025, discusses the decline of American global influence amid internal divisions and economic challenges. Kaplan notes that while the U.S. was once a dominant manufacturing power, accounting for half of global output in 1945, it now contributes only about 16%. Additionally, the national debt has reached $36 trillion, increasing by $1 trillion annually, with both major political parties lacking the discipline to address these issues. This financial instability mirrors the decline of past great powers and threatens the global order they once upheld.\n\nThe recent contentious presidential election has further exposed deep ideological, class, and cultural divides within the U.S., exacerbated by globalization. Kaplan describes a split between a liberal, cosmopolitan upper-middle class and those left behind in the nation\u2019s interior, unable to compete on the global stage. This internal disunity reflects broader global divisions, with Western countries fragmented by globalization and developing nations increasingly distanced from the West.\n\nKaplan argues that America\u2019s internal strife and economic decline have significant implications for global stability. The shift from a print-and-typewriter age, which fostered moderation and reasoned political discourse, to a digital era that amplifies extreme views, has led to dysfunctional politics and the erosion of the political center. As America\u2019s capacity to maintain world order diminishes, the article warns of creeping anarchy and a more unstable international landscape.",

The amount of naval vessels and logistics that need to be in place to cross the 85 ish mile (130km) of open water to move troops and materiel is mind boggling.  And if I am honest I don\u2019t think they have the skills to do it. \n\n2) they still have the Strait of Malacca problem. The moment China starts to make it look like they very well might invade The US will park half of the 7th fleet in the strait. Even if they managed to take Taiwan, it would be, in a best case scenario a Pyrrhic victory for the PLA or what is left of it. And more reasonably their military would be decimated and their economy in ruins. Which makes me wonder if party insiders wouldn\u2019t use it as an opportunity to move against Xi. \n\nAnd realistically the PLA has a lot of the same issues Russia has with graft. And they are largely untested in combat. The most recent actions they saw in (I think Sudan) the moment the PLA came under fire dropped their weapons and ammo and retreated to the UN base.

Instead, the Chinese security/intelligence services are making the call on whether an invasion is possible, *and* on whether they should inform the political leadership of their analysis. The decision-making responsibility is no longer based on an extensive analysis of the facts on the ground if political contestation within the Chinese bureaucracy is impossible. Instead, Xi Jinping's impulses and ideology are the prime variables in the likelihood of an invasion. Analysis involving Xi Jinping's ambitions or ideology is thus much more important for the likelihood of an invasion attempt than the military strategic situation on the ground. \n\nSecondly, US analyses of the likelihood affect the likelihood of an invasion. The US government will probably invest in its defence capacity in the Indo-Pacific to achieve a higher level of credible deterrence if US analysts see the likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as very high. Deterrence can only work if it is made credible through defence capacity investments that follow the threat increase. If the perceived likelihood of invasion is high, the willingness to achieve a higher level of deterrence goes up, which means that the (real) likelihood of invasion goes down. It's the other way around as well: if the perceived likelihood of invasion is low, then the willingness to invest in deterrence goes down, which means that the likelihood of invasion goes up. Answering these types of questions has to take into account the strategic consequences of the way you answer the question.\n\nIn the end, what is important is that we work together to make sure that it does not happen. War is awful. Even winning a war leaves you regret your losses. One life is one world, and we should strive to save that world.",

Strategic support and arms runs, sure, but I'd be gobsmacked if they sailed the fleet in and laid it all on the line.

The pipelines in from Russia are horrible exposed strategic targets in the event of a hot but non-nuclear exchange, but even without an 'accident' they'll never meet supply needs without tankers. Likewise, a vast majority of Chinese refineries are concentrated on the north eastern coast and are asking for trouble if things really went off. Edit: [Here's a slightly outdated but still useful map showing the key routes for oil and gas imports into China](https://i.insider.com/555365196da8119c29e8a313?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp) \n\nNow I make no claims on the strategic reserves of China, but I do know that they're going to struggle to sustain a consumer economy on restricted supplies - internal pressures would add up within a couple of months I think.

China depends on energy imports to keep their economy functioning (Arab/Persian oil) and the US, without too much difficulty, could block this via the Strait of Malacca.\n2. An amphibious assault is a treacherously difficult logistical nightmare. The last thing you would want is for your enemy to KNOW you're planning on it and thus get prepared, making it far more difficult.\n3. Dependence on the US dollar for economic stability. This one I'm sure people will argue over the most as the conversation can get very convoluted, but essentially China is a huge exporter and relies on the US dollar to sustain this. Without finding a way to reduce this dependence, which rather than dwindling has continued to increase, there aren't a lot of options for China outside of accepting huge economic disruption and thus risking the very worst thing that can happen in a country like China: mass societal unrest.\n\nFor more context on the final point, history is a good guide as to why this is so significant. Of the top 5 most deadly wars in modern history, 3 are conflicts that occured within China, and 2 of which were civil wars.\n\nWant to know the other 2? WWI & WWII",

China is poking and prodding to find weaknesses but a large scale invasion of Taiwan would not just be a military blunder, but an international relations blunder. Therefore, China will likely never use military force to invade, but rather try to seriously increase their effort in covert operations to turn the populace and government to be Pro-China. It has had limited success in the past, such as with elected officials, but they will likely increase their funding of cyber influence to win the populace.\n\nWar games have Taiwan even resisting Chinese invasion alone for at least a year before intervention from U.S. and allies arrive. Hypothetically of course, US response would likely be immediate. Tawain has very few boat landing sites (east side is mountainous), sizable home infantry (140k active, 1.5 million reserve), and serious anti air defense(Sky bow, and patriot)  to ward off invasion. If the United States does intervene it will be the end of the CCP. Their economy will likely be in shambles, borrowing to fund the war will dry up. Not to mention military destruction. While China has been building up its anti-aircraft carrier cruiser fleet, they likely don\u2019t have the experience and ability to withstand a long drawn out military conflict. Remember, China has very few allies. \n\nIf for some very small chance China launches an invasion, the United States would lose all credibility of protection if they did not intervene. United States therefore will draw a line and would win. Remember the pacific fleet alone is over 200 ships, and 1100 aircraft, more than China (also better trained and equipped).\n\nThe only path to military victory is the [biological weapon strategy](https://nypost.com/2021/03/11/us-war-games-over-china-threat-warn-of-likely-defeat-report/) unleashed on US military personnel.",

Putin is always *almost* dead, Russia is always *almost* in the civil war, China is always *almost* in the economic collapse, UK is always in the utter collapse from Brexit and on the verge of rejoining EU, Erdogan and Orban and other illiberal leaders are always in some sort of crisis which will supposedly end their rule *very soon*, Trump is always one step away from being *totally arrested forever this time*, Ukraine is always just on the verge of retaking Crimea, et cetera ad nauseam.\n\nAs much as I am pro - democracy, pro - EU, pro - West person myself, I have come to the painful conclusion that I simply got caught into yet another Internet echo chamber that simply reinforces by magical wishful thinking about what I *want* to happen in global geopolitics. It especially got clear regarding Ukraine - I am Polish and I would love for Ukraine to utterly defeat Russia, but I got utterly burned out by this year's bullshit moving goalposts of Ukraine supposedly always achieving great victories... despite never meeting previous expectations and timelines. At some point I simply started realizing that I have good memory and remember previous assumptions about \"Russian collapse\" completely failing to materialize again, and again, and again...\n\nThe most fascinating psychological phenomenon for me is \"moving goalposts\" in this kind of magical thinking. According to last year's expectations, this year's Ukrainian achievements on the frontline have been nonexistant (the frontline barely moved at all). And yet Ukraine according to reddit was still achieving only staggering victories this year and no defeat whatsoever - simply by constantly redefining what (supposedly) were goals of the Ukrainian military. Currently we are at the phase *'you putinist troll, obviously it was Ukrainian plan to not move whatsoever this year, this is prolonged plan to take out Russian artillery after which the great reconquest is going to happen SOON!'*\n\nI know I am writing about different topic, but I expect the same to happend to Chinese discourse at some point, I wanted to write to you OP, how I think you absolutely shouldn't take your opinion on China from reddit discourse. On reddit China is always going to be \"collapsing\" and Xi is always going to be completely incompetent in everything, no matter what happens. This is democratized aggregate of information, and Internet always turns such abominations into complete echo chambers only confirming what given subculture wants to believe. Reddit wants to believe authoritarians are weak and stupid and lose (a belief I want to have as well), facts be damned, cognitive dissonance has to be rejected.",

They also are facing critical issues in regards to energy, food and water security that are being made worse by climate change and geopolitical forces. You can expect to see unrest from citizens in response to these issues (we saw the biggest protests since tiananmen square last year). \n\nDoes that equal \"collapsing\"... depends on your definition. I prefer to think about it as a long term crisis/decline that will dominate Chinas fortunes for the foreseeable future. Will the CCP lose power? Will China break apart?

If you mean \"collapse\" like the collapse of USSR in the late 80s, I think the answer is no, China as an authoritarian State is not collapsing. Their highly sophisticated State apparatus is capable of handling recent crises they're facing. I would say the CCP government will still stick with them for a long while.\n2. However, China is indeed declining in terms of economy power. Since early 2000s China has been the biggest benefiteer of Globalization. Their industrial productivity is highly intertwined with global market. However, their biggest weak spot has always been high-end techs and R&D motivation, due to their highly volatile political atmosphere that discourage risk-taking behavior. As a result, the \"hot money\" created from global trade has largley been thrown into real estate and infrastructure projects, creating huge bubble in RE market. When the US decides to economically decouple from China, the weak spot is exposed, and the RE bubble is now bursting.\n3. Regarding China's demograhy and their economic structure, their labor population will reach retirement age quite rapidly in the next decade, and their industrial reform seems to have little success at this point. Their population bonus will end soon, and they would probably be stuck in the middle-income trap like most of Latin-american states.\n4. Pension won't really be a problem tho. CCP government would probably just let the elders starve. According to recent [pension reform policy](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-64717327), they seem to be cutting pension return rates. Most of the time CCP would put regime survival ahead of their people's welfare. There's no reason they'll do things differently this time.\n5. In conclusion, China as a highly centralized, authoritative State would probably still be around, but their power will decline, slowly but surely. The final destiny of China is probably another Brazil or Argentina with a more authoritarian characteristic.",

Europeans have tried but when push comes to shove, Europeans can't make up their mind. They had their first test post-soviet union to demonstrate their policy in Europe when the war between Serbia and Bosnia broke out, and they failed miserably. \n\nJust take a look at the title of this article from the NYT: [French Visit Undercuts U.S. Efforts to Rein China In](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/world/asia/macron-xi-france-china.html) \\- which basically amounts to, \"there go the Europeans again, screwing up our plans.\"",

This is a clear cut case of genocide.\n\nAnother clear cut case of genocide is Russia\u2019s abduction of Ukrainian children from parts of Ukraine they have invaded with the intent to Russify them.\n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nI also wrote this previously about Israel, however this was prior to the revelation of rubberstamping their AI killbot https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-ai-system-wheres-daddy-strikes-hamas-family-homes-2024\n\n*What is an unclear case legally is Israel\u2019s actions on Gaza; very often debates on whether they are committing genocide or not depends on which side you are. Legally Israel has taken a number of actions, such as providing leaflets in Arabic to give inhabitants of the region info of the bombing so they could have time to leave, precisely to counter the argument they have intention to destroy an ethnic group; meaning for the law to treat the deaths of civilians as **collateral damage***\n\n*Collateral damage is legally speaking not genocide, because it\u2019s not intentional, it\u2019s collateral. However, it is not proven whether Israel is committing genocide or is this truly collateral damage, so unlike the two cases above, this still debatable.*\n\n*There is something called \u201cto the letter\u201d and \u201cto the spirit\u201d interpretation of law, and Israel is following the law to the letter. Those who argue against Israel, argue in the spirit interpretation of the law, that despite the measures Israel has taken to reduce the number of collateral damage, that the action is not sincere enough to be serious. And that\u2019s actually difficult to prove.*\n\nLike I said, when I first wrote that, there was no evidence that Israel approved bombing of AI chosen targets without confirming for certain their identity. Now it\u2019s different.",

Fauci got a free pass on this for lying in front of congress.  Now we learn masks, ivermectin, all of these things that could not be discussed have alot of nuanced answer and somtimes counter to the establishment tightly knit narrative.  The fact mainstream media -only now- is being used to flip the narrative on us, yes its being propagandized intentionally, and we have to question the constant war mongering and public lack of diplomacy, again, allowed to be discussed on mainstream media.   Don't drink the koolaid.  Oh btw, the feds unilaterally suppressing and promoting said news on our social media sites isn't a conspiracy theory either, read twtter files, lets pick on Elon and give Zuckerberg a free pass and not talk about the massive free speech consequences of these actions, again, that are happening across our social media platforms including here, again, not allowed to be discussed on mainstream media.

It happened before in Russia.\n\nThere is very strong circumstantial evidence supporting the belief that COVID was created at the Wuhan laboratory as part of research in preventing, ironically enough, future coronavirus pandemics and that poor laboratory safety standards allowed it to get loose.\n\nAlso, according to experts even within China, Wuhan would be the least likely place for a new coronavirus epidemic to begin. But as a statement of fact, it is the only place in China where coronavirus samples taken from all over the world were literally being stockpiled. Whereas, the laboratory they were being kept at had been an ongoing concern for US diplomatic officials inside China due to concerning reports about its lack of adequate containment protocols due to poor training and staffing. Incidentally, in November of 2019, several lab workers at the Wuhan lab oddly enough were hospitalized for an unidentified illness that had COVID-like symptoms.\n\nThe people most actively promoting the alternative hypothesis that it was natural spillover from wildlife\u2014namely epidemiological lab researchers and China\u2014all have financial or political stake in doing so. Meanwhile, they have yet to find COVID in the wild outside human populations.\n\nIs this definitive proof that COVID came from a laboratory? No. But it\u2019s likely the best we\u2019re going to get since China, for whatever weird reason, has forbidden any further investigation into this matter. Whereas, I will point out that people have been convicted for murder and sentenced to death with far less evidence than this.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear\u2014even though it was in all likelihood a man made virus and this is the worst biohazard containment breach in human history\u2014this doesn\u2019t reflect malicious intent. It was an accident. But conspiracy nuts want to believe that a country like China would economically knee cap itself just to sabotage Donald Trump, because they\u2019re morons.

In November of that year, the U.S. engaged in a campaign of terrorism and covert operations over several years in an attempt to bring down the Cuban government. The terrorist campaign killed a significant number of civilians.[7][8]\"\n\n\nI don't completely understand what exactly China meant by \"similar goals\" because I may just be a naive American, and they like to call us naive. But perhaps they see Taiwan or Tibet as potential buffer states too.\n\n\nIn a way, NATO's original purpose was to only involve members who play a critical role in maintaining peace. There was really no good reason to invite Ukraine into NATO, knowing it could trigger Putin, who lived through the Cold War and Cuban Missile Crisis.",

He goes into how geographies of regions and countries affected their development. \n\nA big factor is being near or adjacent to other trade and manufacturing centers.\n\nSo like with the USA for example: as he states, the USA won the geographic lottery. The USA just has so many benefits geographically that aided its development. For one, our interior was largely prairie and plains, except for the Rockies. It was easier for settlers to push and settle inland. Build roads and railways. Then, we have two coasts: one facing the manufacturing and trade center that is Europe, and the other facing the manufacturing and trade center of East Asia. Along with that, we have a ton of great, natural harbors essential to having ports.\n\nBrazil on the other hand\u2026.what\u2019s their interior? It\u2019s a huge impregnable jungle that to this day is huge and impregnable. Where does their singular coast face or across from? The West coast of Africa. Not a manufacturing or trade center. The West coast of Africa is quite devoid of good harbors and is not able to have as many major ports relative to the size of its area and population. \n\nIndia is shielded and historically actually quite isolated from East Asia because what\u2019s between them on the land? The highest mountain chain on Earth.\n\nI\u2019m really simplifying his overall arguments of course. Just trying to give a primer as to why the book is interesting and worth reading. \n\nA random thing I took away from the book was the prominence, importance and advantage of navigable inland rivers. They were the tractor trailers and trains before those existed. China, Europe and the USA have an abundance of large navigable rivers they were able to use move tons of goods from inland to the coast and vice versa. They are still important to this day.",

But unless the plan is to leverage that Naval power in direct conflict, or the threat of impending direct conflict, it's mostly irrelevant to the superpower-ing of a superpower.   \n\n\nYes, economically China is linked to the rest of the world, and if they're cut off, their economic progress will cease, but if covid showed us anything, it's that we can't live any better without them either. There basically isn't a consumer sector which doesn't get demolished by the excision of Chinese supply, and unless the plan here is total war, i don't see how this analysis is relevant to the reality of China's rating.

        "body": "**That's my claim at least since 2006 when I was a teenager** and it seems to be more accurate with every year. \n\nTo be more precise - Peak China is now. Or maybe we're even past it. My main points were always:\n\n**1) poor demography**, upcoming collapse of the population number. From 1.4bln it's expected to fall to 0.7bln-1bln. It's well known for 2-3 decades now that this will happen. What's even more important - this reduction is partially planned. Reasons later.\n\n**2) not enough critical natural resources**. Especially in terms of fuel. Makes China again dependent on huge imports.\n\n**3) not enough good crop land**. It makes China again dependent on imports in another critical sphere. Chinese croplands can feed 0.7bln to 1bln. The exact number China population is expected to fall.\n\n**4) inefficient economic system**. It could be changed, however it's not being changed for the better. Their economic system is set to be a tool to drag the economy from a rural backwardness having loads of cheap work force to middle-income trap. But it seems the Chinese political system is unable to reform itself to a model that would drag the economy from the middle-income trap to a developed economy. \n\nEven more - during Xi's office time their quality of the system sunk, IEF dropped from 60+something to 50+something which is a prognostication of an economic and social catastrophy. However this step backward from what China has been 30, 20 or 10 years ago has been expected. It's China.\n\n**5) enviroment**. They didn't watch out to keep their land fertile. Some parts of it are being lost due to wrong decisions in terms of irrigation, water distribution policies, building up areas and ordinary not-caring. All that puts more limits on agriculture productivity.\n\nWhat does it all mean? **Chinese population is too big** (compared to the amount of productive land they have) to be more or less self-reliant which makes China hugely dependent on importing critical resources like food and energy over more and more fragile supply chains. **Which makes it easy to push them against the wall**. They're like a big elephant in the room, but this elephant can't do anything that would be really, really harmful. I see last trade wars we were experiencing as a call to order, which China is pretty much loosing looking at data. Also - China is de-forming the system that brought them success now while not being able to present a model that would drag them higher.\n\n**You could say that when the population drops China will be able to become more sovereign in their decisions** being less dependent on long supply chains from abroad that are easy to cut. Besides, they're going to sow Gobi desert with turbines and solar panels which would solve the energy issues. That might be true. \n\nBut then again. It doesn't solve the problem with creating an economic model that would elevate them from the middle income trap they're about to end up in now while at the same time in those 3-4 decades from now (after the drop) they won't have cheap workforce anymore that enabled the current model to spin.",

China is all about handing out money to make allies, which really isn't how you foster long lasting alliances.  All of these smaller Belt and Road countries are just paid for but they don't really share similar ideals or cultural values to China.

        "body": "So first lets ignore the fact that Xi's China has been going in the direction of more repression. Being a democracy with a free press is no guarantee of not invading other countries or of good treatment of minorities. The US as a liberal democracy with a free press invaded Canada and Mexico in order to try to gain land, not to even mention the Indian wars (look up for example trail of tears).\n\nFor your specific points.\n\n2 A free(er) press would make it harder to hide and lie about the treatment of the Uyghurs and Tibetans. Also most Chinese are moral and would not take kindly to things like having state run concentration camps with millions of people in them, and those with a stronger sense of Chinese culture would not consider the destruction of graveyards an acceptable thing to do. Even if the CCP allowed a bit more internal discussion of policy, I think the treatment of Uyghurs and Tibetans would improve. Probably the treatment of Han Chinese would improve as well. The increasing concentration of power in China requires increased repression (driven by greed and fear of loss of control).\n\n1 Most Chinese I have talked to who were educated in (mainland) China believe that Taiwan is a part of China, and those who could accept Taiwan is independent already have to be careful not to be called out as traitors (I'm talking about first generation mainland Chinese who are citizens of the US and Canada not citizens of China), so I don't think that if China became a democracy with a free press much would change very fast. People would have to come a long way to be able to have open and free discussions about politics.\n\n3 Big countries all want to be top dog/powerful (US, India, China and even Britain back in the day), so I don't see how press freedom would change this in China. One difference with China is that it does not generally like to be on an equal footing with other countries, it doesn't have a history of being an equal. It is the \"middle country\", this could slowly change if it were a liberal democracy.\n\n4 Aren't you just contradicting yourself here? If they have less censorship (ie a freer press) will they still want to have censorship (ie a less free press)?",

        "body": " *Edited on Jan. 1, 2019.* \n\nIn our [outlook for China in 2018](https://sinoinsider.com/2018/01/china-in-2018-seven-points-to-watch/), we said that a Sino-U.S. trade war is \u201cunavoidable.\u201d\n\nWith the trade war well underway, an escalating factional struggle in the Chinese Communist Party, and the revolution in U.S. policy towards China, we believe that 2019 will see even more turbulence in China and the world than 2018.\n\nWe expect to see three broad trends in 2019:\n\n1. 2019 will be a year of decisive battle between China and the United States. U.S. policy will determine the battle outcome.\n2. Sino-U.S. relations will be tense. China will be increasingly isolated by the international community and the CCP\u2019s expansionist agenda will hit a brick wall. Meanwhile, the U.S. will continue to reshape the CCP-hijacked world order.\n3. China could see political Black Swans and charging Gray Rhinos in the economic and social arena. The CCP regime will likely face immense challenges from inside China and abroad.\n\nWe present our 2019 China outlook.\n\n## Politics\n\n1. The CCP factional struggle will escalate. Retired members of the Politburo and its Standing Committee may even be purged. Serving senior officials are also at risk of being investigated.\n2. Xi Jinping remains at risk of being targeted by coups from political rivals. Xi\u2019s supporters will likely also be targeted by political opponents if they are responsible for policy failure.\n3. Personnel reshuffles should occur frequently throughout the year, with a younger generation of officials being promoted in large numbers to more senior positions.\n4. Xi will likely continue to clean out the political and legal affairs apparatus, the propaganda apparatus, the intelligence apparatus, and the financial system.\n5. A Black Swan event could imperil the CCP regime. (For more, see our [2019 special report](https://sinoinsider.com/product/2019-a-waterloo-year-for-china-and-the-united-states/).)\n\n## Economy\n\n1. China\u2019s economy will deteriorate across the board. Many key economic indicators could hit record lows.\n2. The People\u2019s Bank of China could cut its reserve requirements several times and adopt monetary easing policies.\n3. The renminbi will likely drop below the level of 7 yuan to the U.S. dollar.\n4. China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves could fall to historically low levels.\n5. China\u2019s capital outflows could be severe, and the authorities could tighten capital controls.\n6. The central government may order more infrastructure projects, but will find it tough selling bonds to fund the projects.\n7. The central government will introduce tax reduction measures, but will unlikely trim a proportionate number of government workers. As a result, corporate tax will be subtly raised, not decreased.\n8. The central government will continue promoting reform and opening up, and may even implement bold reforms in Hainan Province.\n9. China\u2019s property market may see an increase in auctions and more homeowners may have difficulties in paying their mortgages.\n10. Chinese companies may start selling off their property assets to pay off debt.\n11. Property prices will likely fluctuate drastically (small spurt in prices followed by sharp drops). Property prices in some areas may fall by as much as 30 to 50 percent.\n12. More cities may scrap their policies restricting homeownership.\n13. A few major property companies could file for bankruptcy.\n14. China\u2019s stock markets may fall to historic lows.\n15. Pledged shares are at high risk of a meltdown.\n16. There is a possibility that big Chinese tech companies (not including Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) could collapse in 2019.\n17. Some financial institutions may go bankrupt.\n18. Local debt defaults will increase.\n19. Foreign enterprises who primarily export to the U.S. may shift supply lines out of China or leave the mainland in large numbers.\n20. Corporate closures will become more frequent and severe, resulting in a sharply shrinking manufacturing sector and sluggish retail sales.\n21. The wave of unemployment will become more serious.\n22. Food shortages may worsen, and the price of staple food may rise sharply.\n23. The price of gold and silver in China will rise.\n24. If Sino-U.S. relations improve, there is a chance that China\u2019s economy will improve as well. Changes, however, may not be immediately noticeable.\n\n## Military\n\n1. Xi Jinping will continue to frequently reshuffle top military officials and commanders.\n2. A few PLA generals could be publicly investigated.\n3. The PLA will strengthen its presence in the South China Sea.\n4. The CCP\u2019s military expansionism will be impeded by a worsening economy and the international isolation of China.\n5. Barring major incidents in the CCP factional struggle, the scale and frequency of domestic military drills will likely be lowered in 2019.",

        "body": "## Society\n\n1. Social tensions could become unprecedentedly fierce. Expect to see more rights defense incidents from disenfranchised individuals and groups, and even cases of police protests and petitions.\n\n2. The CCP will clamp down harder on society, including implementing stricter controls over speech, further human rights abuses, and increased persecution of dissidents and religious groups.\n\n3. Indiscriminate murders and \u201crevenge on society\u201d violent incidents could become more frequent and severe in 2019 as compared to 2018.\n\n4. Aside from the African swine flu, other forms of contagious diseases could break out on the mainland. The authorities, however, will only divulge more information about a disease outbreak when the situation becomes too problematic to cover up.\n\n## Cross-Strait relations\n\n1. The CCP will likely persist with its \u201ccarrot or stick\u201d approach to pressure Taiwan to return to the mainland. CCP tactics include stepping up influence and interference operations to widen the divide in Taiwanese society; economic and military coercion; and further isolating Taiwan on the world stage by getting Taiwan\u2019s allies to switch ties to Beijing, threatening foreign airliners or other companies that list Taiwan as a country, and other diplomatic action.\n\n2. The CCP could offer attractive terms to the ROC government to sign a new consensus or peace treaty.\n\n3. The CCP will likely step up military activity (sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, sending jet fighter patrols, missile testing, etc.) near Taiwan to intimidate the ROC government. However, Beijing\u2019s bark will likely be worse than its bite, and there is a very low probability of a military invasion of Taiwan in 2019.\n\n## Sino-U.S. relations\n\n1. The U.S. and China could hold a high-level summit in February. Xi Jinping may visit the United States.\n\n2. China and the U.S. could reach a framework agreement which Washington finds acceptable by the end of the 90-day trade negotiation period in March. Further Sino-U.S. trade talks will be held.\n\n3. The U.S. may raise tariff rates on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent before June. President Donald Trump may order 25 percent tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese goods in the second half of 2019.\n\n4. The Trump administration will continue to reshape the current world order (in areas such as trade, military cooperation, diplomatic relations, etc.) and advance the isolation of the CCP regime on the international stage.\n\n5. The U.S. could reassess Hong Kong\u2019s status as a free port, and even consider reclassifying Hong Kong as part of the same customs territory as mainland China.\n\n6. The CCP could downplay overt efforts to influence and interfere in American politics and society. However, the CCP could step up the scale and speed of covert subversion activities like espionage and cyber hacking.\n\n7. The U.S. will likely step up efforts to counter CCP subversion, including raising awareness about CCP influence operations, sanctioning individual Chinese officials, companies, or government departments, and prosecuting Chinese lawbreakers.\n\n8. The US. will continue challenging the CCP on human rights and religious freedom issues. Key perpetrators of persecution in China could face U.S. sanctions.\n\n9. The U.S. could increase its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S. military could hold more joint military exercises with countries in the Indo-Pacific, but may cut back on exercises with China.\n\n10. The U.S. will likely move to strengthen and deepen its relationship with Taiwan economically, politically, and militarily. For instance, the U.S. may sell advanced weaponry to Taiwan, and U.S. warships may dock in Taiwan.\n\n11. As a result of the CCP factional struggle, the PLA might engineer near-collision (fighter jet or warship) or \u201cmisfiring\u201d incidents to escalate Sino-U.S. tensions.\n\n12. A Black Swan event could tip the Sino-U.S. confrontation in America\u2019s favor, and produce one of two opposite outcomes in China. (For more, see our [2019 special report](https://sinoinsider.com/product/2019-a-waterloo-year-for-china-and-the-united-states/).)\n\n## China and the world\n\n1. The CCP regime will come under U.S. military pressure as America withdraws from the Middle East and shifts forces to the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n2. European countries will likely fall in step with the U.S. in curbing the CCP due to energy, national security, and geopolitical reasons.\n\n3. The countries in the Indo-Pacific region could edge closer to the U.S. against China and more strongly resist CCP influence operations and other subversive activities.\n\n4. U.S.-Russian relations may improve, and China will not benefit from the improvement.\n\n5. There will be good progress in the peace and denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula despite signs of \u201cbacksliding\u201d from North Korea. Kim Jong Un will likely visit South Korea, and may have a second summit with President Trump to sign a joint peace declaration.",

        "body": "I know exactly how you feel since I spent 2 years furnishing my 260 sq meter home in Shenzhen...\n\nThe real reason is that such contract work is very fragmented.  They are usually run by tiny companies.  Most of them don't even have a business license or pay proper pension/insurance.  There are very few big name companies that can somewhat assure you of the quality.  Even those few companies sub-contract work out to smaller companies/teams/random individuals.  Professional ethics are not their forte.  \n\nWhen I furnished my home, there were a loose network of several dozen standalone contractors I had to deal with.  I had a separate contractor even for the kitchen counter top alone (coz the cabinet provider was charging me an arm and leg).   They don't often sign contracts with you.  It's usually word of mouth.  If something is wrong, the referrer will help coordinate a fix/compensation.\n\nBy my estimate, 10% of the craftsman will do a good job.  25% CAN do a decent job but will look for ways to slack off whenever they can.  65% do completely shit work regardless. Period.\n\nThe key is securing an expert as your quality control guy.   Most of us are not in the furnishing/remodeling business so the workers can easily BS you to accept some crappy results.     You need an expert who can get on these guys asses and force them to do a good job.  I had someone like that and I made sure he was paid very well.  I never haggled with him on any proposed fees and I always paid immediately within minutes (thanks to WeChat Pay).\n\nI had a lot of marble work done in my home, and my QC guy was monitoring the entire period, except he was out half a day for a family emergency.  Turned out the wall worked on during that half day had a \"hollow\" sound, i.e., they slacked off, used fewer attachment points and less glue when the monitoring guy wasn't around.  The rest of the work was pretty solidly done. If you don't have a someone like that, then it's pretty much a crap shoot.\n\nGranted there were still a lot of things I wasn't happy with, but when I shopped for another apartment, I was shocked by how much worse things are in many other (also super expensive) apartments.\n\nAnother business suffering from the same issues is nannies.  Nannies are hired by word of mouth on random basis and there is no assurance of the quality, so you just have to pray that they will not eat your kids' fruits or punch them in the face.",

So folks have no barometer for what a normal or good standard should be, and can't vocalize how it should be done instead. It's like someone who doesn't cook complaining about bad food. They know it doesn't taste good but can't say what should be done instead, especially when every other restaurant has food that tastes just as bad too. \n\nAnd the workers don't care because they don't get called out on it and can get by fine with a chabuduo attitude. \n\nPlus there's a broader part of the culture in general where everyone cares more about face value. People will literally frame a Gucci logo and put it on their wall if they think if it's a high class signifier, rather than paying to fix the mold growing in the wall's cavities.

Ok\u2026.\n\nThey \u201clooked for it\u201d while not letting me back on the airplane for 10 minutes and said nothing was found. I was never allowed back on. My id cards, $700 in cash, and credit card. I was informed by a Chinese friend that they 100% pocketed it since the cash and western id information is so valuable to them. \n\nThankfully I had my passport.\n\nMy father send money through the western union bank (or whatever it\u2019s called) so I could survive and get back to America. I had no money except my passport.\n\nI had an emergency $100 I used as a bookmark thank God.\n\nThat bought me a taxi ride to the hotel I already reserved and I\u2019d just have to wait 3 days to get new funds. Food was cheap and I still explored.\n\nWhen I went to the bank, they refused to help me and said only Chinese locals are allowed to use it and that my passport wasn\u2019t enough (in the broken Chinese I could understand). I couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThankfully at a bar that same night, I befriended another weiguo who spoke fluent Chinese and he got angry for me\u2026.

From there, it only became easier the days after and we felt like locals by the time we arrived in Shanghai 1,5 week later.\n\nThere were a few hiccups though. Entering the country with the two week visa \u2014 no one seemed to heard of it.

Europe is threatened by Russia and China tacitly supports their war. China threatens Taiwan everyday with violence. China throws its weight around in the vicinity of Vietnam and the Phillipines. North Korea tests missiles by launching them over Japan and China supports them. But sure. This is the country that's going to lead the world towards greater safety. Meanwhile Trump gets a ceasefire deal in Palestine before his term even begins. He's in a great position to bring an end to the war in Ukraine this year. If the CCP wanted to show global leadership in contrast to an ostensibly more isolationist US, they should've had a hand in bringing about an end to these episodes of violence. If Trump has a substantial role in ending these two conflicts, this seriously contradicts the idea of a US withdrawing its leadership from the world stage.  \n  \nEven honing in on the scope of the article, this idea is comical. See [this article](https://www.fiia.fi/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wp115_chinas-responsibility-for-the-covid-19-pandemic.pdf) about how the Chinese government acted during and after the pandemic. I won't bash China about climate change. It has a lot of people and they need to use energy. As it stands, meeting the current energy demand requires coal. There's no getting around it. Even after stepping out of the Paris Climate Accord, the US government should continue to support the development of renewable energy sources.",

Thus, Chinese historians typically regard these regimes as regional administrations within China, akin to the states during the Warring States period. Therefore, it's considered an invasion of the Southern Song by the Mongols, rather than an invasion of \"China.\" After all, no one would say that the State of Qin invaded \"China\"; instead, it invaded other states like Zhao and Chu.",

She was cosplaying as Nezuko, a popular character from Demon Slayer \u2014 one of the most popular animes in recent years. The video began with a security guard saying \u201cPlease understand. Please leave the venue.\u201d Upset, the girl then requested the organisers to explain the regulations to her in person. Initially, the security guard responded with \u201cThese are the rules, there is nothing we can do about it.\u201d However, as the cosplayer refused to leave, the security guard blurted:\n\nWe do not allow kimono here. This is China.\n\nThe video then transited to the cosplayer escorted out of the venue by the security guard. Despite being chased away, the cosplayer continued questioning whether there were rules prohibiting her outfit. She was then handed to another security guard, who replied \u201cYou cannot wear this\u201d.",

The IRA is definitely helping, but interest rates on all sorts of renewable energy development is keeping our project growth both stagnant and uncertain\n\nEdit: Adding to this as I saw on another comment that \u201ccapacity =/= generation\u201d. This notion is very true, but the difference here is that growing capacity allows for that energy generation to be used as soon as it is available; you are effectively planning for the future generation. What I am finding in my professional work is that we have plenty of generation projects and not enough capacity for the grid to handle that generation, effectively making the energy plants that are constructed partially useless until there are interconnection upgrades made to the power grid. I.e. you build a 300MW solar plant but the grid can only handle transmitting half of that until the grid gets upgraded. By that point, you\u2019ve already used up years of that solar plant\u2019s design life and are therefore not using it to its full extent. Working backwards in these scenarios is mostly not ideal.",

Invariably a countries system is not a monolith; some areas are good, others terrible, same with practicioners, specialists, equipment and testing availability etc. If you are rich vs if you are poor, and so on. That being said, I in no way doubt your experience.\n\nWhat I can say is that from the feedback I've received from friends and family from many differing countries in the past several years is that the quality of care in all of these places has noticably and aggressively reduced since around 2020. Slower, irresponsible, aggressive, incorrect treatment, incorrect diagnosis (or being refused diagnosis and treatment), reduced access to testing/imaging, proper pain management etc. \n\nNow, there are many obvious and not so obvious reasons as to why this is, but it is a truly sobering realisation for all of us. \n\nIn addition (and in light of this) I want to commend you for noticing and realising something few understand: **That when a person is pushed to their limit, physically or mentally without treatment, answers or relief, no matter how educated, rational or reasonable that person is, they WILL do anything and everything that could possibly help in any way.** Anything. \n\nThey are not foolish, they are not crazy; they are desperate. \n\nSome people profit from this but a lot of the time it's just desperate people who all have a similar problem, along with desperate families who are scrambling to do anything **other** than nothing in the face of complete helplessness. It's less about avoiding death and more about mitigating suffering at all costs. So thank you for recognizing that for what it is.\n\n\n**(Concerning the familys attempt at the extention of someones life in the face of terminal illness and suffering)**:\n\nOddly, this is where that very same familial compassion tends to circle back and align with the system in most places (which often failed them in the first place) and divert from that of the afflicted.\n\n\nIf all avenues serve only to prolong **life** alone as a diffuse concept ABOVE the will, intense suffering and indignity in a human being, we are acting in cruelty. \n\n\n*We are more humane to our terminally sick or injured pets \u2013 even gravely injured wildlife on the side of the road; in almost all cases if we see greivous injury and intense suffering we relieve them of that out of compassion.*\n\nWhy then do we insist on the opposite for our loved ones? People who can actually communicate their position?\n\nEither way, I find I feel very angry on behalf of your sick family member, how powerless they must have felt in light of all this. I hope they are at peace.\n\n(That being said I think that you bringing it to the attention of others, that their story is being told may give them solace \u2013 and speaks highly of your empathy and character as a whole. So, thank you.)",

Here's a story.\n\nWhen HKU opens its Shenzhen hospital about a decade ago, there was a huge culture clash between the two groups of medical staff and academics. The HKer were shocked when ER doctors in SZ were sticking needles in everyone -- regardless of need -- even if the IV just had salt water. They also sold saline at a high markup.

Second is that Westerners in general have a different travel culture than to what you find in China already. Many don't like the mass touristy destinations and prefer off the beaten track and find the 'real' culture of the country. That's what a lot of people do in Europe where I from.

It also lists the social media giant Tencent, China\u2019s most valuable technology company.\n\nOther firms of note added to the list are China\u2019s top commercial-jet-maker, a DNA-sequencing firm with U.S. ties and two companies at the heart of China\u2019s surveillance-technology boom.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/06/pentagon-blacklist-china-technology-ev/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/06/pentagon-blacklist-china-technology-ev/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",

It would go from a possibility of US defense to a more sure one. \nAs for Trump telling Europe to pay for their defense, it was because most countries in NATO were not spending the money they agreed to making the US have to cover the bill. After Trump, many countries added more to their military budget. I\u2019m sure you saw the post earlier about the massive gap between the amount paid by the US and NATO.

Tourism is a good cashcow for Xi'an, and many of the ancient structures are getting \"restored\". The whole city wall was rebuilt in 1980. My mom said there were homeless people who lived in the city wall before the restoration, as they were carving the mud wall base and living inside of the hole in there. \n\nAnd after 2000s there are a lot of new parks were built on top of the historical sites to promote tourism. This was dumb and the central government quickly realized that. Around the end of 2000s the approach to the historical sites were quite conservative - leave it underground unless you have to disturb it.\n\nTherefore, currently there are a lot of city gardens now in suburban Xi'an that are scattered everywhere. It's because the land might be granted earlier for development, but during the building process, some relics were found on the site. Then immediately the whole block has to be preserved, which usually means that a small park would be built on top of it and the historic site would be exposed by covering a glass on top of it.",

        "body": "This question brings up the famous Ship of Theseus Paradox that is relevant to historical reconstructions/archaeology:\n\n\"The\u00a0**Ship of Theseus**, also known as\u00a0**Theseus's Paradox,**\u00a0is a\u00a0[thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)\u00a0and\u00a0[paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox)\u00a0about whether an object is the same object after having had all of its original components replaced over time, typically one after the other.\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship\\_of\\_Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)\n\nThe vast majority of tourist attractions around the world that are in decent condition have had historical and/or modern maintenance and repairs done where they replaced the original materials with new materials long after the original creation. The Colosseum in Rome was actually in ruins by the middle ages and had to be significantly rebuilt during the premodern and modern era. This is especially true for tourist attractions in East Asia - China, Japan, and Korea where wood was the primary building material but wood only last several centuries. Thus, they have to replace the wood over time (either replace the wood in premodern times centuries ago or more recently in the last 1-2 centuries).\n\nJapan's famous tourist attraction Himeji Castle was originally built in 1333, was rennovated with new materials several times over the centuries and then abandoned in the 1800s. It was left to decay and then bombed in 1945 during WW2 where what was left was heavily damaged. So most of the modern Himeji Castle you see today was rebuilt in the 20th to 21st century - however, it was rebuilt with traditional building techniques and materials resembling that of the original construction. Another example is Japan's Ise Grand Shrine that is rebuilt every several decades with new wood...making it an entirely modern construction.\n\nThe main difference is modern China has a notoriously bad reputation for rebuilding/reconstruction historical artifacts/buildings. In Japan, reconstructionists might use wood, stone, and building materials similar to the original construction, some Chinese reconstructionists use concrete that doesn't remotely resemble the original building materials. For example, when trying to reconstruct parts of the Ming era Great Wall, some Chinese reconstructionists used concrete instead of brick and stone. This resulted in parts of the wall that looks jarringly out of place.\n\nSo basically everybody reconstructs and repairs their historical sites with \"new\" building material, but modern China often does a bad job at doing so by often not using the material that resembles the original materials used in construction.\n\nEdit: I see that other people are given extremely overly simplistic (if not flat out incorrect) answers blaming all of this on the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution did not destroy the Tang Dynasty Daming Palace in Xian that OP is talking about. The Tang Dynasty palaces (Daming Palace) in Xian were destroyed many centuries before the modern era. The ruins and archaeological site of the Tang Dynasty Daming Palace weren't even discovered until the 1950s-1960s. Furthermore, modern China isn't even communist (they adopted capitalism in 1978), and this bad reconstruction problem is a modern phenomenon.",

In china the history is more imbued in the site itself than in the authenticity of the buildings. It\u2019s more about the legends and historical figures associated with the site. Most Chinese would rather view newly constructed buildings in a supposed historical style that are beautiful and intact than more authentic run down ruins (as is the preference in Europe). This is just the culture in China. Of course there are exceptions. But remember, many of the actual historic buildings were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.",

        "body": "It\u2019s not just China. South Korea and Japan are similar. Although their reconstructions are at least done in a less obviously modern way. \n\nConservation in the west has changed and evolved over time, there used to be a lot more restorations and reconstructions. We now focus on preserving and conserving what\u2019s there and not filling in the blanks with our best guesses. But that\u2019s the style in most of Asia. It\u2019s not less authentic necessarily it just prioritises different end goals. In the west we want to do the least amount of intervention to stop stuff from disappearing forever, and we provide information panels and guides and stuff to show what things may once have looked like. In Asia they prioritise giving a picture or an experience of what things once used to be like. They choose a snapshot in history to recreate. It\u2019s not meant to mistaken for the real thing necessarily, but it is meant to give visitors a real experience. It\u2019s also why so many of these historical tourist sites in Asia (especially Korea and Japan) rent out relatively accurate historical costumes for visitors to wear as they explore the snapshot of history that has been recreated. \n\nI would challenge you to look at it less like a caricature, and more like Trigger\u2019s Broom. In the classic British sitcom \u201cOnly Fools and Horses\u201d the character of Trigger (played by Roger Lloyd-Pack, perhaps more famous as Barty Crouch Sr. in \u201cHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\u201d) is a slightly slow on the uptake but good natured street sweeper. In one episode the local council he works for gives him an award for using the same street sweeping broom for 20 years. They applaud him for being so frugal and saving the council money by taking good care of his tools. In his acceptance speech he mentions that over the years his broom has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles over those 20 years. Of course that means that no part of the broom is even close to 20 years old. But culturally and to Trigger it\u2019s still the same broom. Those modern reconstructions you see are really more like Trigger\u2019s Broom than a cheap copy.\n\nEven in conservation here in the UK we still use the Trigger\u2019s Broom model. It\u2019s especially useful in the conservation of early 20th century historical vehicles (tanks and planes mostly) from WWII. The educational and cultural value of seeing a still operational WWII tank or Spitfire plane outweighs the loss of certain parts and components that inevitably have to be replaced in working machinery of that age. A lot of the engine components in those planes and tanks for example are not the original components. But even without it being a \u201cperfect\u201d artefact of history it can teach us more about the time in which it served than it could as an immobile fuselage in a museum. \n\nAs an archaeologist generally (and a conservator specifically) when I first visited China I was a little disappointed too when I realised that rather than preserving ruins they had opted to reconstruct them. It was just a knee jerk emotional response, I couldn\u2019t help it. It was very much as you described for me as well. But because of my training as a conservator I was able to see, on reflection, that in China and most of the rest of Asia their goals for conservation aren\u2019t necessarily any better or worse, just different. This allowed me to appreciate Chinese historical sites in a new way. And it\u2019s also useful to know that the same happens in reverse. Chinese tourists here in the UK are often a little disappointed to see that many of our famous castles and monuments are in a carefully stabilised and conserved ruinous condition, rather than what they\u2019re used to back home.\n\nAnyway, I hope my professional knowledge and my own experiences travelling have helped. I actually ended up doing two different month long trips in China. On the second trip I visited several of the places I had visited the last time again, only this time I approached them with a different mindset and expectation. And I found the experience to be far closer to the magical experience I had anticipated before my first trip. Xi\u2019an is especially dear to me for that reason. I highly recommend visiting China again if you can with this Trigger\u2019s Broom analogy in mind!",

Even Kyoto's historical sites which claim to be thousands of years old are completely new reconstructions that all date back to somewhere in the Edo Period between 1603-1868.

When we were at SAS there were six kids in the \u201chigh school\u201d half of whom barely spoke English when it was in a single building at the girl\u2019s school on Jiangsu Lu. One of my good friends was Austin Hu, who would later go on to open Madison and Diner. My dad had an imported dark red Oldsmobile and he\u2019d get pulled over for all kinds of foolishness, including \u201cwasting electricity\u201d because he had his headlights on at night. Pudong was still mostly farms, but I remember my dad taking us to see the Pearl Tower when it opened up, explaining how Pudong was going to be a whole new city in a few years, then taking us for hotpot at Yaohan/BaBaiBan. Service was virtually non-existent then, to the point that I remember the first time a glass was placed in front of me, with ice, and a coke was poured into it by the waitress. She still didn\u2019t smile though. It was at Isetan on Huaihai Lu, and I had the Japanese style seafood spaghetti with tomato sauce and it was so damn good. \n\nThe sky was grey and dismal then even when it was clear. Suzhou Creek was more trash than water. Spittoons were everywhere but barely used and everyone smoked and spat and stared. Little kids wore those split seat pants and adults pissed in the streets. But it was the smell you never forget - earthy cement, disturbed soil, and acrid smoke hung in the air for over a decade as the city was a busy bustling construction zone. \n\nShanghai Center / Portman was the one oasis in the city. Mei Long Zheng was the spot for greasy xiaolongbao. Tai Bei Xiao Chu on Huashan Lu would later become the Gap which would become Bellagio and fuck did I love that place. But Su Zhe Hui by the old JinJiang Hotel across from the Garden Hotel would later capture my heart, and be the first place I\u2019d want to go everytime I went back. You didn\u2019t eat on the streets though, even though those deep fried cong you bing were pleading for you to eat them; there were rumors they put detergent in the youtiao to make them extra fluffy. So we\u2019d eat at the clubhouse at home, the Longbai in Hongqiao, where we\u2019d eat black pepper pork chops and drink delivered milk in glass bottles that you had to skim the cream off of, which I was convinced was some kind of industrial byproduct. \n\n15 years later, I would be living in Jinqiao and working in Nanhui. The skyscrapers I could once count with my fingers were now innumerable. I\u2019d take the shiny new efficient subway into the city, or drive myself on the elevated road, always marveling at all the buildings that flew by, wondering what life was like inside of them. I\u2019d play poker on the weekends at Bubba\u2019s then hit Velvet, Mint, Cotton Club, or that one underground place with the red walls that smelled like my frat. Getting Peruvian at Azul, or those cumin pork ribs at Di Shui Dong, or a plate of dumplings for 6 RMB, counting the number of Starbucks and DTFs and Bellagios that were opening up. I even think about those 2 RMB lunches we\u2019d get at work, complete with grey rice, hairy pork, chicken bones and bony fish. \n\nDo I get nostalgic? Hell yah I do. Never when I was 12 years could I really imagine Shanghai would grow up to become what it was, even if there was a massive scale model of the future city at the Urban Development Museum. I loved showing off the city to my friends that would come to visit; I imagine that\u2019s what a proud parent does with their kids, babbling on incessantly about this new building or what that used to be or how XTD was nothing like the old Shanghai I knew. But maybe more than any of those people that came, Shanghai was an old, close friend, one of the few that I would actually grow up together with. And it\u2019s awesome, and with a tinge of pride, seeing others enjoy and love the city as much as I do.",

Sure, it was always there, but you could easily ignore it and the State was sort of parallel to the daily life; now it's everywhere and in everything. Xi brought back vanguardism and made the Party front and center, so you can't avoid it the way you once could. Back in the day, you might get people paying some lip service to the government, ticking boxes, but that was all put aside and sometimes they'd openly be negative about the government without fear of consequence. I knew a teacher (Chinese, in a state school) who got away with criticizing the CCP in politics classes for about a year before they clamped down on it. He wouldn't last 48 hours now. The confident China has disappeared, which is ironic as the current guy in charge is obsessed with 'cultural confidence' and 'telling China's story well'. He didn't notice that China was already like that.",

I speak Chinese pretty well and don't need to use English at all in China. \n\nI'm married with a kid now, and I haven't been back to China since 2012. My wife is Chinese though but has a green card and a career here. My kid is 7. \n\nWe live in Seattle and it's starting to feel bleak to me here. The cost of living (especially food) is becoming absolutely insane. We both make low six-figures but it feels like going to get a sandwich at a lunch place is an extravagant luxury. I find it so difficult to connect with anyone my age, especially other parents. There's no sense of community and I basically just hang out with my family and that's it.\n\nWe thought about moving to China for a while so my kid could learn Chinese and know what it's like. I think if we did it would be around Jinan. I've read through these comments about how much worse it's gotten, but I've heard from other friends that it's better in a lot of ways (less spitting, less queue jumping, more \u6587\u660e basically). I think I'd put my kid in an international or at least private school--I don't trust the state education system to teach critical thinking, and I don't want him to see school as just a competitive numbers game for the gaokao.\n\nAm I stupid to be considering doing this? Is it just nostalgia? I think about just walking outside in the evening and getting cheap food at a place with those little plastic chairs in an alley somewhere. Hanging out at some \"square\" and doing basically nothing. I miss meeting Chinese people and having them just say \"We should be friends,\" vs. Seattle where you are playing a game of chicken to see who can come off the most disinterested.",

Yes, China built large dams, but also Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. \n\nFurthermore, the idea that dams lead to droughts is false. Large dams might cause some reduction when they are filling up, but in the long run, they contribute to regulating water flows and mitigating the hazards of droughts and flooding (as they are designed to do). The largest impacts that dams have is on sediments and aquatic ecosystems, not water quantity. \n\nChina definitely needs to be transparent and cooperative in managing the Mekong River, though.\n\nPS: There have been multiple reports about the impacts of dams on Mekong river. Most have mentioned the undeniable effects of dams on silt and sediments, as well as on livelihoods of farming and fishery communities downstream. However, still little evidence is supporting the notion on the impacts of dams on water discharge. There are some reports from Eyes on Earth indicating that, but there are also counterargument.

On an ordinary morning, outside a Japanese school, Hu Youping, a dedicated school bus attendant, demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of a horrifying knife attack, shielding a Japanese mother and her child. Her bravery would cost her life, but her legacy will live on, immortalized by the lives she saved and the hearts she touched.\n\n**The Incident:** It was a serene day when chaos erupted at a bus stop in Suzhou. A 52-year-old Chinese man, consumed by malice, attacked a Japanese woman and her child. Without a moment's hesitation, Hu Youping intervened, throwing herself between the assailant and the victims. She fought valiantly, her only weapon being her unyielding spirit and her desire to protect those in danger. Though she suffered grievous injuries, her actions saved the lives of the mother and child, who sustained non-life-threatening wounds.\n\n**Tributes and Honors:** News of Hu Youping's heroism spread like wildfire, sparking an outpouring of grief and admiration from around the world. The local government, recognizing her unparalleled bravery, bestowed upon her the title of \"Righteous and Courageous Role Model.\" The Japanese embassy in China, in a poignant gesture of respect, lowered its flag to half-mast. In a heartfelt statement on Weibo, the embassy expressed its sorrow: \"We believe \\[Ms Hu's\\] courage and kindness also represent that of the Chinese people. We pay tribute to her righteous deeds. May she rest in peace.\"\n\n**A Community United:** The Chinese social media sphere was flooded with tributes. \"We will remember your kindness and bravery, for you protected the safety of our Japanese friends and preserved the reputation of ordinary Chinese people,\" read a poignant comment on Weibo. Another user hailed her as an \"ordinary, virtuous, courageous Chinese sister.\" These heartfelt messages reflected a collective reverence for Hu Youping's sacrifice, transcending national boundaries and fostering a sense of shared humanity.\n\n**A Sombre but Uplifting Ceremony:** In a grand ceremony befitting her heroism, Hu Youping was laid to rest with honors. A sea of mourners, both Chinese and Japanese, gathered to pay their respects. The atmosphere was a mixture of somber reflection and uplifting gratitude. Dignitaries, officials, and ordinary citizens alike stood side by side, united in their admiration for Hu Youping. The ceremony was a testament to her bravery, a celebration of her life, and a solemn vow to remember her sacrifice.\n\n**Legacy and Impact:** Hu Youping's story is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. Her actions on that fateful day embody the ideals of courage, selflessness, and the unbreakable bond of humanity. In the face of senseless violence, Hu Youping's bravery shone as a beacon of hope. Her legacy will inspire future generations to stand against hatred and violence, to protect the vulnerable, and to uphold the values of compassion and unity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hu Youping's sacrifice is a story of extraordinary heroism that transcends borders and cultures. It is a tale of a woman who, in the face of danger, chose to act with unparalleled bravery. Her legacy will continue to inspire and remind us all of the profound impact one individual's courage can have on the world. In honoring Hu Youping, we honor the best of humanity. May she rest in peace, her spirit forever a guiding light in our hearts.",

And it started since Ming dynasty, because we hated Korean emissaries.\n\nThe difference now is that we are no longer the global hegemony we were, but we still think we deserve the respect, which is pathetic.\n\nChinese think they are the civilized ppl surrounded by barbarians, even to this day. Yeah, I agree CCP didn\u2019t help but it was already in our culture and tradition. They just amplified it for their own benefit.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9 is more or less a western imported idea.

        "body": "I understand where you are coming from, but the problem is most of the opinions you have is either ungrounded or should i say just a little bit hypocritical.\n\nOld China? I'm sure others already pointed out... old China where and when...? Modern China after the 21st century is easily the best period of time for ordinary Chinese people politically, culturally, and economically. Missing 'old China' is not different from a deep south redneck missing America before the Civil War - you only miss it because your skin color is White and you fancy yourself an owner of a plantation.\n\nThe fact that you think USA treats its allies with respect is funny. USA and its people is not fundamentally better than anyone else or any other country. A century ago USA is not that much different in many ways than modern China. Went to war with both of its neighbors, took a chunk of land, established hegemony in America, became the world factory, copied a lot of technologies, etc. Then with WW2 it became the sole superpower in the world. Oh you think British Canada and Mexico decided to become US allies because oh wow US is such a polite country that treated with with civility? I'm sure the native Americans would agree as well, they decided to give up their land willingly because they were touched by the superior Christian morality and democracy huh?\n\nIf you even want to talk about hegemony control in diplomacy.. the US has over 200 if not more military bases in the world and financial dominance with US dollars. Let's take it all away and see how many countries follow US then. Or are you like Trump that truly believes that NATO is for charity? The US decimated the Japan economy, especially their semiconductor industry, in the 90s. US forcibly took over Alstom from France. China simply didn't surrender because whoops we don't have US bases all over us, and it has a certain degree of financial independence. Unlike Europe and South Korea and Japan, China has the ability to say no.\n\nRecent political conflict between US and China I have barely seen a single case where China escalated a conflict. In the 90s Chinese embassy has been bombarded \"by accident\" by the US. A pilot was killed once. Commercial ships would be stopped for no reason. Even the recent trade war started from the US, under Trump. China has never done anything that exceeds the scales of actions taken against it by US. Trump singlehandedly eliminated the pro-America voice in Chinese politics. Thanks, Mr Trump.\n\nAnd not to mention China has been trying to welcome foreign investments and students to study in China... when I was in university in China, there's quite a lot of Korean students at our school that are much much more under-qualified compared to their counterpart Chinese students at the same universities, yet receive full scholarships just because universities want to allow more international students in.\n\nIf anything the Chinese government has been suppressing the nationalist sentiments in China for decades. People in China has been accusing CCP of being too soft to the West for decades. Didn't do anything when a military was killed, just verbal protest. Didn't do anything when they blatantly violates our territories. Didn't do anything other than verbal protest when a trade war suddenly just happened to us. Can you even imagine the American public and politicians being 1/10 the level of this calmness? They freak out over a weather balloon and TikTok.\n\nBut again, if you believe everything from the Western propaganda, or if you don't even believe such propaganda exists, then nothing I can say would be able to change your mind. That's the sad part of today's media and politics, it's just competitive brainwashing. In the US the election is pretty much a competition of who brainwashes more voters before November.\n\nI'm also very certain you have no idea what Confucius wanted in the first place. The critique of Confucius, and the old culture of China, started way, way, way before the cultural revolution, much earlier than CCP even took over China. It is ridiculously funny whenever I see someone else who has complete no knowledge of Chinese history paints CCP as the \"destroyer of traditional culture\". This is such absurd Western propaganda. Traditional Chinese culture dictates women never leave home and never see another man other than the husband. Traditional Chinese culture dictates that a man be absolutely loyal to his superior. Traditional Chinese culture dictates that the will of the emperor is absolute. Yeah, that's the old China that miss so much.\n\nSure, in the same way, the Civil War destroyed the American Southern way of life. If you ask a black person oh do you miss the good ol' deep south, he will throw a punch at your face.",

And for what gain? What would China actually gain? Nothing. \n\nChina has been doing quite well without Taiwan and will continue to do so. Why fix what isn't broken?\n\nWhat China should do is endorse Taiwanese independence and this will allow it to bring Taiwan under its wing: militarily, economically, and diplomatically. Ultimately, this is what China wants, right? And this can be done so much more easily, and bloodlessly, by giving the people of Taiwan what they want: independence and formal international recognition. In the end, everybody wins with Taiwanese independence, even the Chinese, whether they choose to believe it or not. \n\nThink whatever you may about the CCP, but they aren't stupid. That's why they cannot bring themselves to invade Taiwan. Even if they reach a point where they will be able to, I don't think they will actually do it...  The Taiwan issue is simply a power play for the CCP to use as a bargaining chip, their \"red herring\" if you will. \n\nThe world needs to have a no-kidding intervention with Xi. Everyone knows how terrible a Chinese invasion would be, even for the Chinese and they know it.... So let's cut the crap. Beijing it basically holding a gun to their own head shouting, \"don't make me do it!\" \n\nMany countries have had to come to terms with the realization that they no longer have a right to claim territory that they used to own. Look at the UK, France, Spain, Japan, and even the US (yes, the US even ceded territory like the Philippines) and the CCP never controlled Taiwan to begin with. Join the club, China.

Welcome to Taiwan's virtual war room, where decorated generals and officers this week are being tested against the most chilling scenarios \u2013 from a full-scale invasion to cyberattacks and blockades of critical infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe highly classified annual \u201cHan Kuang\u201d military drills come under the shadow of very real threats from Taiwan's hostile superpower neighbour.\u00a0\n\nRecent months have seen an uptick in warmongering rhetoric from Beijing matched by intensifying air force and naval activity around the island 110 miles off the Chinese coast.\n\nChina\u2019s Air Force has made sorties into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone on a near daily basis since last September, hitting a record high of 25 fighters, including nuclear capable bombers, on April 12.\n\nThe daily screech of jets has alarmed the United States and nearby Japan, prompting Washington to warn China it would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d to take Taiwan by force.\n\nWhile there are no signs of an imminent Chinese attack, China appears to be setting the stage to\u00a0make good on a long-promised threat to annex the island, by force if necessary.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan - a democracy of 23 million, which functions like any other nation with its own government and military \u2013 but it claims the island as its own territory.\n\nMilitary strategists warn Taiwan does not have the luxury of time to practice defending its shores.\n\nChina could invade within the next six years as Beijing rapidly steps up its\u00a0challenge to American forces in the Indo-Pacific, Admiral Philip Davidson, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific command predicted in March.\n\nHis warning is likely to weigh heavily on Taiwanese military chiefs over the eight-day Han Kuang war games, where computer simulations switch between mock threats of conventional beach landings and aerial assaults to electronic attacks and psychological warfare.\n\nIn July, the military will shift to live-fire exercises \u2013 landing fighter jets on highways and testing its tanks and artillery for combat readiness - to project a more overt show of force to deter Beijing from aggression.\n\nTaiwan is not only crucial to the global supply chain of semiconductors but also lies at a strategic point of international trade routes. Control of Taiwan would grant China its much-desired open access to the Pacific coastline,\u00a0presenting a challenge to Washington\u2019s free and open Indo-Pacific strategy. \u00a0\n\nGlobal leaders are also being forced to consider the worst-case-scenario of a Chinese invasion that could draw the Indo-Pacific region and the West into armed conflict with China.\n\nJoseph Wu, the Taiwanese foreign minister, said this month that Taiwan \u201cwill fight the war if we need to fight the war,\u201d pledging that \u201cwe will defend ourselves to the very last day.\u201d\n\n\nBut Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan business council, said he did not foresee an impending \u201cD-Day-style\u201d invasion.\n\n\u201cMy own view of what\u2019s going on right now is that Chinese operations around the island are primarily focused on psychological operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThis had the twin goal of trying to \u201cup the pressure on the people of Taiwan\u201d and to\u00a0\u201ctest the mettle of the US government\u201d during the transition to the Biden administration.\n\nAnalysts have cautioned that China could also opt to target Taiwan\u2019s infrastructure and economy or seek to cut off its energy supplies.\n\n\u201cTo me the path for them is much more blockade, potentially taking an outlying island, something that ups the ante significantly but is not actually them shooting at Taiwan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that creates much more political problems for the US and Japan on how to engage than starting to mobilise forces.\u201d\n\nKitsch Liao, a Taiwan defence analyst, said this week\u2019s drills \u2013 which pit joint staff members against a hypothetical enemy \u201cred team\u201d of advisers and retired officers - will be key to training wartime decision-makers and predicting the pressures of battle.\n\nThe exercise also trials Taiwan\u2019s war plan to protect its Air Force and deploy its Navy for \u201cdecisive engagement against [China\u2019s] amphibious landing group,\u201d said Mr Liao.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOriana Skylar Mastro, an expert on the Chinese military at Stanford University, said Beijing did not view the current conditions for invasion as favourable but she cautioned the international community against losing a \u201csense of urgency\u201d to take\u00a0timely measures to avert a military move in possibly 6-7\u00a0years.\n\nChinese confidence had been boosted by the restructuring and modernisation of its armed forces under President Xi Jinping, prompting a bolder strategic calculation about its ability to take Taiwan, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think under Xi Jinping there has been a shift in mentality away from just preventing independence towards promoting progress towards reunification,\u201d said Ms Mastro. \u201cHe has given the impression that this is going to be part of his legacy.\u201d\n\nPentagon data estimates China\u2019s defence expenditure is about 25 times larger than Taiwan\u2019s and its active ground forces of 1,030,000 dwarf the latter\u2019s 88,000. It is widely believed that without outside help, Taiwan could only withstand a full attack for days not weeks.\n\nBut despite its military dominance, China\u2019s forces in recent memory have rarely been put to the test on the battlefield. \u201cThe main factor that imposes caution on the Chinese\u00a0is that they don\u2019t know how well they are going to perform,\u201d said Ms Mastro.\n\nChina also did not want to risk its \u201crejuvenation process\u201d or its economic rise through a protracted conflict or potential punitive sanctions, she said, referring to the Communist Party\u2019s long-term goal of building the nation into a global and military power.\n\n\u201cI think the good news is that China doesn\u2019t want to do this now. So they\u2019re not going to be\u00a0pushed by some low level slights..because they don\u2019t feel like they are 100% ready,\u201d she said.\n\nProminent local media coverage in Taiwan about the military drills has generated little sense of alarm among the public, which is largely inured to decades of Chinese intimidation tactics.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is general consensus on the existence and nature of the threat,\u201d said Mr Liao, but he said the public was divided over the ability of the military to repel an invasion.\n\nWhile many would be willing to step up to defend Taiwan, there was a poor perception of the military\u2019s bureaucracy,\u00a0but an overarching view that the US \u2013 the island\u2019s biggest arms supplier\u00a0\u2013 would help. \u201cBelief in US intervention is quite strong,\u201d he said.\u00a0",

It occurred during a broader two-day meeting with their respective teams on Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\n> Three people familiar with the stepped-up engagement said the US wanted to boost co-operation with European allies, such as the UK, to raise awareness about what the administration regards as Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive attitude towards Taiwan, which it considers part of China.\n\n> The US is not engaging the UK because of an imminent threat. The Taiwan dialogue is intended to complement more advanced discussions that the US has been holding with Japan and Australia as Beijing has stepped up military activity around Taiwan. Over the past year, China has flown more and more fighter jets, bombers and other warplanes near the island.\n\n> Admiral\u00a0John Aquilino, head of US Indo-Pacific command, last month told the Financial Times during a trip to Australia to support the alliance that the Ukraine war underscored the risk that China posed to Taiwan.\n\n> One of the people said the Taiwan meeting spanned everything from how the UK could do more diplomatically with Taipei to discussions about boosting deterrence in Asia. It also included talks about what role the UK would play if the US ended up in a war with China over Taiwan.\n\n> The person added that the Biden administration was providing some allies with intelligence on Taiwan that was previously classified as \u201cNOFORN\u201d \u2014 a designation that bars information sharing with any foreign officials.\n\n> One UK official said the restricted meeting was the \u201chighest-level\u201d and \u201cmost significant\u201d discussion between the countries on Taiwan to date. He said it was part of a \u201cdeeper policy conversation\u201d that started during the Biden administration.\n\n> \u201cNaturally, crisis planning would be a hefty chunk of any such conversation about Taiwan,\u201d the official added.\n\n> The White House did not comment on the Taiwan meeting. A UK government spokesperson said \u201cwe never comment on private meetings\u201d.\n\n> Ryan Hass, a Taiwan expert at the Brookings Institution, said it was smart to increase consultations over Taiwan, both to cut the odds of war and prepare for possible conflict, particularly given the \u201cbackdrop of\u00a0Ukraine\u201d.\n\n> \u201cIt is prudent for American officials to consult quietly with partners on what more could be done to deter conflict in the Taiwan Strait, and should it ever become necessary, to respond resolutely to challenges to peace and stability there,\u201d Hass said.\n\n> In a sign of the enhanced co-operation with the UK, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, a British aircraft carrier, last year spent more than six months deployed in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n> Heino Klinck, a former top Pentagon Asia official, welcomed the US-UK consultations on Taiwan. He said they came on the heels of European naval deployments in the Indo-Pacific that increased last year after the Trump administration had held discussions with European allies about boosting operations in the South China Sea.\n\n> \u201cDeterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan is in everyone\u2019s interest. It is not just an Indo-Pacific issue, it is a global issue,\u201d said Klinck.\n\n> \u201cUS military planners are not counting on Germany or France sending warships, or Britain sending a carrier in the case of a conflict over Taiwan. But when those countries send ships to the South China Sea, or transit the Taiwan Strait, it sends a strong signal to China.\u201d\n\n> A senior Taiwanese official said Taipei was aware of the US efforts to involve more allies in its Taiwan planning. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing it with Japan and Australia, and now they\u2019re trying to do it with Britain,\u201d he said.\n\n> Diplomats in three Indo-Pacific countries said the enhanced US-UK initiative took American engagement on Taiwan to an unprecedented level.\n\n> Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, this week said Nato should play a role in Asia. \u201cWe need to pre-empt threats in the Indo-Pacific, working with allies like Japan and Australia to ensure that the Pacific is protected,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must ensure that democracies like Taiwan are able to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nFollow Demetri Sevastopulo and Kathrin Hille on Twitter",

Nothing has ever changed or will change as long as Taiwan is not only a strategic asset geographically but also a manufacturer of a strategic resource, ie, microchips. Ukraine only started receiving support from the US and the west only about 10 years ago despite Russian threats.\n\nThe Trump presidency is much worse for the sovereignty of Ukraine than it is for Taiwan. At best, Trump may try to negotiate peace with Putin by ceding what territory Russia already controls and restoring Russian influence over the rest of Ukraine as what the situation was before the west started supporting Ukraine. At worst, Putin will take all of Ukraine. The third possibility is that we will continue to be at war with Russia via Ukraine as a proxy.\n\nEdit: Recall that the US has built many new bases in the Philippines in response to China's aggressive rhetoric, and even Japan has started building bases on its closest islands to Taiwan in solidarity. There will be a severe military response if China tries to invade Taiwan by not only Taiwan itself but by the combined allied forces of the US and its partners in Asia. Most doubt China will invade because they do not have the ability to maintain control over the island.\n\nEdit: If you would like to learn more about the military capabilities of the relevant belligerents.

At least with Rubio we'll probably see less bullshit and more direct to the point dialogue. For the first few years the administration under him straight up just refused to talk to China. But then he also didn't even get any real progress with china's neighbors. Remember how Obama went to vietnam and normalized relationships? Remember how the CCP went ballistic pushing into Vietnam in the south china sea pissing off everyone there? \n\n  \nWhy didn't he take this opportunity to expand presence there? Instead now China and Vietnam normalized relationships. They're signing trade deals and vietnam's more tied to china than ever since the sino-vietnamese war. \n\nIndia? What happened!? How did we get played by the biggest pushover statesman ever in MODI? \n\nBlinken somehow failed to capitalize on the CCP's absolutely braindead wolf warrior policy and instead went wolf warrior lite himself. Then he wasn't able to get Biden from going full Netenyahu fanboy and at least *pretend* that the USA wore the pants in that relationship. I guess the word we have for this is neo-con and par for the course with american foreign policy.\n\n  \nPathetic. Just pathetic. Now he's a lame duck still taking the ideological view- the trade argument is absolutely deft- Most of the trade across the taiwan strait is going through shanghai. Taiwan makes most of the high end chips absolutely critical to the world but we've also become the bottleneck. If the entire world cannot get high end chips- haven't we just reset the chips race? It's not just China loses supply of 3nm 2nm chips but the WORLD loses leading edge fabs. In a world without TSMC suddenly the gap between the west and china has shrunk to one or two generations unless you think Intel is about to suddenly reverse decades of corporate rot and replace TSMC.\n\n  \nGood riddance. I hope Rubio does better- his china report seemed miles ahead of the absolute trash that came out of Blinken and thinktankco\u2122 but is still tinged with the same delusions of american exceptionalism. China is the soviet union with a functioning rational government and a functional economy.  America's grown fat and lazy from decades of absolute political, economic and military dominance. There's a real peer in the global stage and we still act like they're perpetually one week from collapsing.",

        "body": "OP, I really admire your commitment to the bit. You've got an active imagination. I wish you much success in your creative writing career.\n\nFor those of you who think this actually happened, think about it:\n\nThe part where OP failed language school and made the funny comment to his wife \"I ought to just be in your first grade class\" is believable. The rest is not! Let's indulge the idea they actually tried it. It wouldn't last more than a week, let alone 6 years. OP would be too bored. He says he went to school and then taught at a cram school after school to make money? No one would put themselves through that for free. The wife wouldn't put up with that. The school and its students' parents most definitely would not put up with that.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to have a grown adult as a student in class. The students need to learn with their peers. An adult in the class makes that odd and confusing. Does the adult get disciplined like the children? Is he a student or a teacher? It would make for a weird and disruptive classroom dynamic. Every adult knows this.\n\nNo matter how trusting or kind parents are, there's no way they would be cool with this. Yes, they would be cool with him as a teacher for the class. Not a fellow student. The idea is absurd. Any school principal would know this, and would not put their reputation on the line for such a silly idea.\n\nLet's assume OP, OP's wife, and the school principal were totally on board. The city government that runs the school most certainly would not be. There's no way that tax dollars and school resources would be allowed to support an adult going to school as a first grader. (Let alone a foreigner!)\n\nOP has produced dates and pics as his \"evidence.\" C'mon, y'all. OP taught English to elementary kids for a few years and has pics with his students. All teachers do.\n\nOP made a wisecrack to his wife and then indulged a fantasy about what would really happen if he Billy Madisoned his way through Taiwan. And you commenters all bought it. Please exercise your critical thinking skills.\n\nEDIT: for clarity",

The polls in the US are running 50/50 Trump/Biden.  Trump is not going to open the borders for Taiwanese...he's got to appease his racist core.  And he doesn't give a shit about the down stream consequences for the US or world economy.  \n\n50/50 is a high likelihood, no?

If that makes sense.\u00a0\n\n\nHe also mentioned he's European and Europeans, depending where in Europe, seem to have very strong views on nationality and ethnicity.\u00a0\n\n\nHis one complaint was he couldn't get a sense of unique Taiwan identity and it all seems to be about Chinese history. Firstly, most of his museum visits were museums created during the KMT regime so there's already a specific bias there. And secondly, it came across as someone who has zero idea about Taiwan's history. Which isn't EXACTLY his fault but a quick Google would have explained things to him. That complaint of his made me chuckle because it's like complaining about Australia not having a strong specific Australian identity. This is what happens when a country is relatively young or jave has to deal with multiple invasions and takeovers and have mass immigration from one place over a period of time. It begs the question of what is Taiwan's identity? Which if he had Googled, is exactly what's happening right now politically.\u00a0\n\n\nHis other issue is he only travelled in Taipei. That doesn't give a full picture of Taiwan.\u00a0\n\n\nHe also mentioned everything is sweet. I have no idea what he's talking about. Sounds like someone went to the wrong places to eat - which again, isn't his fault. Maybe he just sucks at finding the hidden gems but then when people point that out, he gets defensive saying he did go out of his way to find hidden gems - but his itinerary doesn't translate so.\u00a0\n\n\nBut anyway, every one can have their own views. My Singaporean relatives will complain about Jiufen being too old and they should just pull it down and rebuild it to something more modern.\u00a0",

(some places offer old school food you cant find in japan anymore)\n\n5-many japanese tourist at least for those building otakus can find pre war urban building in taipei that no longer exist in tokyo. (the old bank building is a prime example).  My family will have at least once a year onsan trip to Japan.\n\n  \n6- education style is somewhat same with japan .  Japanese as a major is very popular and Japan is still one of the top places that students want to go study...even for adults who are in the design and craft fields japan offer a lot of good work courses for Taiwanese.  My aunts still speak japanese and recently they took a 6 month pottery work shops in japan. \n\nfinally most of us grew up with japanee pop culture and also the food style and we were taught by our family to respect things and follow rules...even though these days i kinda see lacking now...anyway hope that answers fit what you looking for.",

Or maybe it's a side effect of becoming a generally wealthy society. I don't really recall any of these being prevalent in Taiwan in the 80s and 90s, it just shifted gradually in this direction in the past 2\\~3 decades. \n\nSorting garbage is probably one big exception -- Taiwan developed its garbage disposal culture pretty much indeginously, and it's more just the practical aspects resulting in the two countries converging towards the same result.\n\nTaiwanese cityscape look similar to Japan only superficially. There are tons of differences if you look closer, from the Japanese preferring small 2-story detached homes over Taiwan's 4-story row houses; Taiwan's qilou inherited from Minnan architecture; Taiwan's general avoidance of commercial establishments in TRA/MRT stations; etc. There's enough difference that I would not mistake one for another if I just randomly woke up one day on a random street. \n\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, the closest to Taiwan in general vibe is probably Macau, where some parts are [eerily similar to Taiwan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1c2j7Wne9ZGjubNA9), down to the run-down facades, iron bar over windows and rooftop additions.",

For instance, Japanese at that period living in Taiwan frequently visit restaurants such as \u689d\u901a - its cooking style, and food more or less have influence on Taiwan, even though Taiwanese's food style already borrows some ideas from Japan during Japanese period. Further, entertainment like music, TV shows, particularly comedies, were popular in Taiwan around 1980 \\~ 2000.  People may attempt to follow the trend in Japan, even rules may be copied from Japan. Thus, it's not surprising that some parts of Taiwan look like that in Japan.",

Conversely, I\u2019ve seen Taiwanese and Japanese crowds that act unruly once the social contract of politeness is broken - eg certain mob behavior or just a break down of the norm.\n\nAnyways, all of that is to say that the younger generation in China are very sensitive to things like standing on one side of the elevator, not littering, or not bothering people, etc. And in most major cities on the mainland it\u2019s becoming rarer to find bad behavior, and instead it can sometimes feel the strictness of Japan or Singapore too.

Visited Taiwan twice (third time upcoming) and spent there about 1.5 months so far I feel you hit the nail on the head. 3 comments on it:\n\n  \nAbout the food and your comment of fruits; first time I went to Thailand and had mango I thought Thailand had the best mango's. Then I went to Philipines and had mango, and I thought PH had the best mango's. Then I had a mango in Taiwan and I think Taiwan is the definite winner in this regard. I truly like Taiwanese food but I can understand that people are a bit disappointed if they compare it to japanese or korean food. But the good thing is that Taiwan is very international with regards to food, so you can eat whatever you want. \n\nWith regards to the MRT (and HSR), I think Taiwan is possibly the best given the constraints they have. Yes you could argue that China has more HSR, Korea has more Metro's and Japan has... well I think Korea has better metro's, or at the least less confusing stations :-) But Taiwan has a lot of constraints and they manage them fine. About infrastructure, don't forget to look at the 101 and realise that it used to be the tallest building in the world up until not too long ago, and it is in a typhoon/earthquake area. Which is truly insane if you think about it. \n\nFinally, about the small things and enjoying looking at people who do that, I was absolutely blown away (in a good way) about people using public spaces for hobbies. I have seen so many people play music dance and streetperformers and I just \\*love\\* it. I'm from a cold dark rainy country and I love to be outside when I can but often times I cannot. Taiwan takes that public space outside to a whole different level and uses it. I love to watch all of them. Most memorable moments where Maji square first time, so many groups dancing. Or the Memorial Hall where people where dancing and playing music. Or the random streetperformers anywhere in Taipei and (for me) around Sun Moon Lake.   \n\n\nLooking forward to my 3rd time!",

In the most tea productive regions of the world, you will find teahouses a plenty right around those farm towns, and then nowhere else for miles.",

I spent 2 weeks in the country as a tourist and one of these weeks I spent with friends who are locals in Taipei.\n\nIn this one week I was constantly eating. My friends took me out eating without any breaks. The hospitality was as unmatched as the variety and quality of the food.\n\nI have been to most of the asian countries and most of them have strong food cultures with each overlaping with their surrounding countries cultures.\n\nSo who cares if a dish is local or locally adopted. The food oportunities in Taipei are great and mostly a bargain. \n\nThe people are hospitable and approachable. So agree people are a more important part of the experience than museums or temples. I experienced the mazu inspection in Tainan which was an trove for interaction. I stayed in Hualien during the typhoon and people were so caring and helpful.\n\nOne thing I do not understand in your post. Car culture - I am deeply enrooted in car culture and I did not see any of this in Taipei? Few fancy cars, no modified/tuned cars no local brands? No comparison to Tokio or Hong Kong e.g.",

The food is fine, I don't know what's traditionally Taiwanese though because all the stuff that I ate, I've already tried in China before. I don't think \u7ea2\u70e7\u725b\u8089\u9762, \u9e79\u8c46\u6f3f, or \u5c0f\u7c60\u5305 originated from Taiwan but every small shop run by old ladies hit the spot. The night market food did get a bit repetitive and I didn't want to eat it anymore nearing the end of my stay. That being said, the AJOY buffet @ Taipei 101 was excellent and great value.\n2. The tea is also fine, went up to Maokong and they did it \u529f\u592b\u8336 style like the rest of the minnan people. I think the global reputation for Taiwanese tea is more so for boba?\n3. I went to the National Palace Museum and the National Museum of history and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. I like Chinese history and Taipei houses the best treasures since the KMT brought them all to Taiwan. I'm not too fussy about the curation.\n4. The Taiwanese people are some of the friendliest in East Asia, we went bar hopping one night and met some locals and they ended up taking us to a bunch of other cool spots later that evening. Contrast that with my Kyoto leg of the trip and I was denied service at multiple restaurants just for not speaking Japanese.\n5. The crowds in HK/CN/JP were much worse than Taipei, also I cabbed everywhere so I didn't notice any infrastructural dysfunction.\n\nThis was my 2nd trip to Taiwan and I enjoyed both of my trips - I guess it just depends on each individual's expectations and open-mindedness.",

        "body": "1. The idea of \"good food in Taiwan\" comes from the fact that Taiwan received a huge influx of mainlanders in the closing days of the Chinese civil war, and many of them brought very authentic cuisine from their hometowns, which greatly expanded the scope of Chinese cuisine in Taiwan. Beef noodles and xiaolongbao are two great examples of this. Unfortunately, as the old generation dies out, it's much harder to pass down that tradition, while China opening up to the west also meant that Taiwan is no longer unique. Taiwan has a chance though -- it adopted western food relatively early (partly due to US influence when military personnel were stationed here), and probably boasts some of the most authentic Japanese food outside of Japan. There are oppurtunities to expand on this and create some unique Taiwanese food, and boba milk tea is a great play. However, I do agree that night markets are overrated for the most part -- it's not all that special nowadays.\n2. I've always felt tea wasn't entirely for the quality per se. Like, when you have a drink with friends, the atmosphere, the chat, and just being there are more important than the quality of your drinks. Taiwan does boast some excellent tea, and there are people that care a lot about them, but as an average Taiwanese I never cared much about tea other than just something to soothe the throat while chatting.\n3. Taiwanese, as a personal observation, are no longer keen to show off. Or to put it another way, it seems generally accepted that there isn't much you're required to do outwardly in order to uphold some kind of social status. Even cars aren't strictly necessary, and I don't own one. This leaves a lot of leeway for me to decide where exactly I would like to put my money -- it's not that I don't *know* some products I buy or use does not have craftmanship or finesse under them, I just *don't care*, and instead I'm able to put a lot more money in things I actually do care about. I'm not \"making do\" -- you just don't see the length I'm willing to spend on the things I actually love and care about.",

What I realized is that you can pretty much think every country is shit if you focus on the negatives. It usually comes down to some combination of safety, weather, work, food, health, housing, transportation, or convenience.\n\nTaiwan had the least of the downsides and plenty of upsides. From conversations with other foreigners that made Taiwan their home, it is clear there are plenty of things to gripe about. Weather is brutal in the summer. Housing is challenging, but compared with NYC and HK, it is not terrible. Salaries and jobs are not great, but way better than options in Thailand, Vietnam, or Indonesia where a lot of foreigners have been gravitating towards in recent years.\n\nMaybe somethings will emerge as I spend more time in Taiwan, but ultimately my early experience has been very positive and has met my expectations.

        "body": "Your second point is correct, especially in regards to buildings considered 'historical'. Once a building is declared as having historical value, the government then requires all renovations etc to be in keeping with its current style, something that massively increases prices for the owner. A lot of times, if a building is under consideration as a historical landmark, it will \"have an electrical fire\" and suddenly burn down. Whoops! Guess we'll just have to build a new building with no restrictions.\n\nBesides that, a lot of these old buildings (I'm looking at you, Da'An and Zhongzheng) were built in the 1950s and 60s when the KMT government was *sure* that *any day now* they would be returning to China to retake the mainland, and so the buildings they put up were cheap and utilitarian and very much not designed to be maintained over a long period of time. That also extended to their exteriors, which were mostly covered in water-repellent tiles.   \n  \nTiles are great for a lot of reasons, but... let's say they get moldy, as happens in Taiwan. What exactly can you do about that? Power wash them? They'll fall off. Scrub them? With, what, a wire brush? That'll take hundreds of hours and is quite dangerous for workers. Use a chemical anti-mold agent? Sure, and poison the neighborhood as you do so.\n\nIt's just a bad position. The amount of time and money it would take to even temporarily fix this problem is too high to be considered, and that's assuming people see it as a problem. For the most part, the mold on the outside of the building doesn't affect the comfort or value of the houses inside, so from a developer's point of view why bother?",

Therefore no one feels the need to renovate existing structures, as it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t see any return from the investment\n\nOne way I was made to understand the mentality towards property here is that the majority view property not as an investment, but as a depreciable asset similar to a car. As in, it has a shelf life, and the value of the property is expected to decrease over time - especially from new. For this reason, just as most people wouldn\u2019t start modifying a 15 year old car with 100k miles, people in Taiwan won\u2019t renovate a 25 year old apartment/building. This is even more true when you consider that the first thing someone does when buying a \u2018second hand\u2019 home is to completely gut it and start again, regardless of how nice it previously looked\n\nThis is at odds to many western countries, where homes are investments, and do not commonly have a shelf life. This means that you buy a 100 year old house in say the UK, and after a structural check pass, you\u2019re confident it\u2019ll stand indefinitely. Any renovations or work done to the property only serves to increase its value, so it\u2019s in the interest of the owners to improve their property as much as possible",

I\u2019ve been here almost two months to try and understand certain points. I am from Orange County. I am in XinYi district. \n\nBasically before I even go into it, I\u2019ll just say, you will trade your work life balance for all the other conveniences, meaning in the US, you\u2019ll have a better time finding a job where you\u2019re not working 10-12 hours for 5 days versus here. \n\nI\u2019ve realized a lot of people here don\u2019t have many interests except for work because of how heavily incorporated work is embedded in their culture. I have many thoughts about this, but it\u2019s irrelevant. Basically, I don\u2019t agree that working 40 years during the best time of your life makes any particular sense, but to each their own. \n\nHealthcare in Taiwan is incredible and the #1 thing I haven\u2019t seen mentioned surprisingly. If I ever get major illness, I will be back here. It\u2019s cheaper here than it is in the US with insurance it\u2019s ridiculous.  \n\nThe MRT is convenient, but it also doesn\u2019t go everywhere, so a 15 minute car ride can easily turn into a 45-50 minute commute, but the traffic will take some getting used to. I\u2019m gladly willing to sacrifice the 15 minute commute to save $800 a month on gas though! \n\nUtility bills here are reasonable and also not $400/month. \ud83d\ude0a \n\nThe food options are readily available and you can get 40 grams of protein for $2 USD at the 711. \n\nEverything here is wildly convenient, but in the way that it is so that you have no excuse to not spend the rest of your life working haha. (Half-kidding). \n\nThe people here will take care of their own, it\u2019s incredible. I love that, money can\u2019t buy this. \n\nA lot of people here live with their parents though and I know that\u2019s a thing in the USA, but the people here have very\u2026fierce work ethic. Good and bad. \n\nSpend all day working, but those high expectations of themselves will lead to high expectations of others. \n\nBut as I understand, most people do live with their parents well into their 30\u2019s. This society is very family oriented, much different than 18 year old free bird from the US. \n\nAnyway. I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet. \ud83d\udc80",

Better career opportunities and salary cap in the U.S. compared to Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s high earning as an employee usually means you work at TSMC, anything artistic or athletics will not make you any money vs the U.S. If you could get your own business started you might have a chance to make a lot more, but considering many people in their 30s make around 45-65k twd a month, realistically, it\u2019s not gonna get you anywhere in terms of living quality. I have friends working at large Taiwanese corps for 2-3 years and making 45k a month. Their rent in Taipei is 18k. \n\n2. People talked about Taiwan being more diverse and liberal, in many cases yes as young people in Taiwan are pushing hard for diversity and equality, however, Taiwan is also extremely not diverse and liberal in the opportunities you get in your careers. Taiwanese education system does not respect anything else except grades and tests. If you are wealthy enough to put your kid into \u201cinternational schools,\u201d they are not cheap, coming to almost 40k usd a year (Taipei American School) , many other ones go around 20-30k a year, and many has \u201cparent screening.\u201d If you wish your kid or your career to be successful in art, music, sports, this is not the place. I got people working as an interior designer at a rather famous studio for 35k a month. Diversity is only what media wanted to make Taiwan famous, many people are still very unfriendly to people from Southeast Asia. (However, I would say people in Taiwan are less alienating to foreigners than Korea, Japan and China.) \n\n3. Taiwanese political parties are a big massive joke with constant hiring and having internet trolls that spread misinformation just to get the other parties down and uses the China issue to force people to vote for them so Taiwan could be safe. (This is basically brainwashing to say if you don\u2019t vote for certain party, we will be doomed) \n\n4. Are you planning to buy a house? Or real estate? Taiwanese salary will never allow you to buy anything that\u2019s livable in Taipei, considering apartments going up to 50-80m in Taipei, people move to Taoyuan and take HSR to Taipei just so they could afford a house that\u2019s around 100m2 for their family, With 40 years of mortgage. If you plan to live in Taiwan and decide to raise your child in Taiwan and care about education, rent is not cheap. Also, many landlords don\u2019t rent out to older people, so that\u2019s why many people end up having to buy a property. If you plan to live in taidong or hualien, housing would be cheaper but you will deal with more natural disasters for exchange. \n\n5. Are you going to work for a US or foreign company remotely or trying to actually work for Taiwanese workforce? If you are planning to do the ladder, you will have to budget your monthly income because rent in Taipei will cost you 1/2 - 1/3 of your income. If you are living in Taichung, you might be better off in costs but not off by much and you will probably have way less job opportunities. Groceries are actually not cheaper in Taiwan, where we actually look at the prices we get in SoCal for milk, vegetables and meat, it\u2019s actually cheaper than in Taiwan if you go to supermarkets. (Traditional markets are cheaper but it\u2019s a trade off for sanitary and health code violations in some markets)\n\n6. US has its issues tho, delusional issue with pronouns and biological genders. (Honestly from all the people I met around the world, seems like only the U.S. are having these debates). School shootings and gun controls, tying to general public safety and not knowing if it\u2019s firework or gunshots. The whole medical system where you\u2019re one medical bill away from being homeless. The over political correct society in which says they accept everyone but once you say something different about above issues, you\u2019re not accepted, how funny. Drug issues with historical highs in homeless people, and just them living off the streets, many hate crimes and racism, especially when I encounter minorities being racist against another minority (like what the actual fuck). I wouldn\u2019t want my kids growing up in a society like this, the U.S. is a great place to grow up in when you\u2019re a multi millionaire. \n\n7. Individualism vs living as a group. East Asian countries are more towards fitting into the group and being a part of the machine called society where the U.S. stresses a lot on being yourself and you do you. So it\u2019s definitely very different in moving to Taiwan if you\u2019re into you do you. Covid with the mask and vaccine you mentioned in the post is a great example. In Taiwan, many people don\u2019t stand up for themselves or for certain issues because they are afraid to be the target. As a saying goes : \u68d2\u6253\u51fa\u982d\u9ce5\n\nThis is just my two cents as a Taiwanese who gets to travel both countries often for the past few years.",

Elementary years in Taiwan, the academics is better and they already have the benefit of speaking English at home.\n\nOnce they hit middle school and up, the U.S. is far better. Diversity is actually very important, in addition, U.S. education focuses more on understanding, critical thinking, while in TW it's more rote memory and repetition. So if you do have kids and they are elementary aged, it's good to give it a try, and then bring them back for middle school.\n\nBut yes, if you actually get a Taiwanese job, do expect to work crazy hours, that's the culture. Good luck!",

I won't ever have any other dog than a rescue dog.\n\nI often go cycling around north Taiwan, but I have this mental block that insists the dogs I see must, in most cases, belong to \\*someone\\*. There's always a house, or a shack, or a business nearby, so I assume it must be their dog. Unfortunately, I'm probably being naive.\n\nAs someone commented, and as I was recently told, some dogs are semi-'claimed' by the people at a particular business, or village, and they'll leave food out for it. And some of these dogs can actually be quite well cared for.\n\nAn example: months ago I was walking past a local vet with my wife when a big van pulled up and some men inside had a badly injured dog - there was blood everywhere - and they wanted help from the vet. The vet said he didn't have the means to help the dog, given its injuries, but my wife suggested a place they could take him. The dog, apparently, was a stray, and had been set upon by other strays and badly hurt.\n\nNone of these people 'owned' the dog: it hung around their factory because they'd feed it. But they cared about it enough to immediately load it into a van and drive into Taipei to get emergency medical help for it.\n\nSometimes I see a dog and I, too, am sometimes tempted to adopt one of them. But figuring out whether it is, in fact, uncared for is another matter.\n\nThere are people in Taiwan who really care for dogs, but there are unfortunately others who do not, and they're despicable people. But maybe it's the same everywhere. I have found one or two older Taiwanese to be amazed by the suggestion that dogs have emotions or even that they can feel pain. It's ignorance, is all.",

The definition of some people a taken care of outdoor wandering dogs/cats is just fed them. End of. Just fed them. And left unchecked. Poop unpicked. Vaccine or disease unchecked. \n\nI won\u2019t call that taken care of.\n\nAnd the truth is. Lots of these dogs are second generation stray.\n\nSo there is several aspect of this. First is people wrongly believe in \u653e\u751f life release in Buddhism or Taoism religion. They think if they don\u2019t want a pet and don\u2019t want the hassle to rehome them. Let them run loose is great. Give them their freedom back.  They are wild animal and freeeeee like a bird. So they are left out loose. \n\nThis came to the second part is unable to recognise dog and cats are not wild animals. They are domesticated animals and usually not part of the original eco system. Sure there is the Taiwan dog. But these are not the ones being solely abandoned here is it.   \n\nSo usually it started with some people abandoned some dogs or pets. Then they mate and made more wild dogs or pets. Then came the third part.\n\nAs part of the religious idea. Some think feeding the strays are acts of kindness and will get them karma points(not reddit\u2019s but life\u2019s). So they feed them. But have no intention to take them in as pet. They go to a spot and feed them and go home. \n\nThen also the farmers and fish pond owners will feed the dogs in the idea that because this will make them gather and form territorial gangs. It\u2019s great deterrent against farm produce theft.\n\n\nHope this sums it all up.\n\n\n\nEdit:also some people say they let their dogs and cats loose. Because they said it\u2019s for animal welfare and better for them they are happier. And then you see videos of them chasing and killing actual local wild animals and the owner cooing them saying awww my brave doggy killed the rare protected snake for me so brave and cute! This is just natural selection! (Dogs and cats being around and able to kill a local wild species is not exactly natural)",

Note that the hospital has two elevator areas; I went to the one on the north side of the building first, which didn't go up to floor 16. You need to go to the elevators on the south side. Take a number from the sticker machine outside to get in line. Before going, you should fill in the first-time patient details at https://mcloudws.mmh.org.tw/DMZWEBREGISTERA651/index.html?H=TP I brought my super-old immunization records from when I was four years ago to the appointment, which didn't have a lot number, but they photocopied the immunization book and accepted it in lieu of getting titers. Remember to bring three passport-sized photographs for the application. Total cost of the chest x-ray and syphilis tests was 1390 NTD. The results pickup window for the following Saturday was 9 AM to 11 AM; there was no wait when I went to pick up my results. The hospital staff didn't seem to be aware of the permanent resident certificate, so they marked me down as needing a health check for an ARC, which is close enough for me.",

I might've been the first one to try at the one I went to. They did try to push me towards doing it in Taiwan and said it would be faster, but I wanted to get as much paperwork done and ensure I had all documents lined up before heading to Taiwan which is why I decided to apply abroad at my TECO.\n\nMy understanding is it essentially works this way: You apply for a Permanent Residency Certificate Duplicate (\u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c), not a \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49. TECO collates your documents, sends it off, where NIA will issue the duplicate and send it back to TECO for you to pick up or have mailed to you. Then, you go to Taiwan where you exchange the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c for the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49 original and the process continues similarly. I did my health check in the US. My local TECO said I could go to my doctor as long as they stamp it.",

You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve seen mention the USPS fingerprinting \u2014 it was super-fast to receive an emailed copy of the clearance letter from the FBI right after the fingerprints were scanned at a local authorized post-office.  Almost instant.\n\nI did all the FBI processing while in LA.  The authentication of the FBI letter via TECRO took about one week to receive back via Priority Express after I express mailed a copy of the letter + fees + return env (provided TECRO  with pin to the FBI site for doc verification via email).  Getting an appointment with TECO LA took much longer to submit the notarized self-translation of the FBI doc, they barely looked at it- that took a \\*week\\* to receive back their authentication for the self-translation.\n\nI was hoping to travel to Taiwan in 2 weeks, but I\u2019m getting delayed until later in the year. Looks like I may need to go through the FBI authentication again since it\u2019s only good for 6 months.  \n\nEdit:  You mentioned the FBI clearance is good for 1 year?

The form is honestly hard to read and it took me **three tries** to finally get my doctor's office to fill it out correctly. Based on my experience I would highly recommend doing the following:\n\n1) Have an example copy printed where you take a highlighter and highlight all the places your doctor should check mark or fill out. This was especially true for the MMR part because my doctor kept marking it as \"negative\" thinking the question was DO I HAVE MEASLES, not realizing it's AM I IMMUNE TO MEASLES\n\n2) Have spare copies with you when you drop off or pick up the form in case they mess up\n\n3) See if you can request these tests during a yearly physical. My doctor just ordered them for me as part of my physical so my insurance didn't count it as elective.\n\n4) Get all sides/pages stamped by your doctor's office. SF TECO likes stamps.

Just here to post about my experience applying for \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c from TECO Miami and exchanging it in Taiwan.  \n  \nThe immigration officer there allowed me to apply for the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c by mail! Once all required documents were submitted, I got the entry permit back in 3 weeks.  \n  \nFast forward to Taiwan. I entered Taiwan earlier this month and did the exchange at Yilan Service center, not listed on English website, but Chinese one. The lady there wasn\u2019t too familiar with the process so she made a few phone calls to see if she was able to print out the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49. She got the okay and printed it out 15 minutes later! After that I went to the local HHR office to join my Aunt & Uncles HHR and exchange the cerificate for an ID card.  \n  \nApplied for a bank account and NHI here. And just got my passport!  \n  \nNot sure if anyone else is aware, but BOCA Taipei has an appointment system in half hour blocks and it allows you to pre fill your info online and upload a photo here  [https://ppass.boca.gov.tw/sp-ia-login-2.html](https://ppass.boca.gov.tw/sp-ia-login-2.html)  There is a separate check in area, and the check in kiosk gave me an option to print out the prefilled application too, although I already had one printed.

Not properly authenticating and translating documents -- ALL document proofs need to authenticated by TECO, and all non-Chinese documents need to be translated by the courts (and then authenticated by TECO).

Yes, 2 Day Exchange method -- the location can make a difference.   Hat tip to MobsOnTheMove for valuable info in case the HHR address changes, I thought I'd be facing that but things worked out.\n\nHopped off the plane at 5:40am and got my \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c stamped.  They had no problems with my soon-to-be-expiring passport.  Took the HSR down to Chiayi, completed my meetings at about 3:30pm.  I headed to the East District Chiayi HHR building -- fortunately, the Immigration, HHR, and Passport are in the \\*same\\* building, what luck.  \n\n1) Walked into Immigration,  exchanged \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c for the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49.  That took about 10 minutes or so to get the Official Copy.  Yes, same day service, thank you Chiayi!\n\n2) Went to HHR level, fortunately my cousin just became the Head of Household a few days earlier, so he was there to get me signed onto the hukou.  This took about 20 min because they had to update the hukou ming bu and prepare my National ID.  Paid the fee.   After all of the hoops that had to be jumped through (with HUGE thanks to everyone who helped in this legendary thread), I finally got the ID.   \n\n3) Now to the passport office (back to the 1st floor?), folks this is the start of the NWOHR ->NWHR extravaganza.  Bzzt.  Welp, they tried scanning my new ID but it didn't scan.  Bzzt.  Bzzt. After a few tries, it finally did. Hallelujah. Anyway, they took my old expiring Taiwan passport, they complained about my Walgreens-printed photos, and the new passport application form.  I gave them NT$2200 for speedy 24hr service, they said to pick up after 4pm tomorrow.\n\nNext day:  I went to get my newly new NWHR passport at 3:46pm and yes indeed it was ready.  They clipped the old passport and gave me the new one.   I can say that a 2-Day Exchange Method is a possibility for Chiayi folks.  \n\n(Car rental heads up:  Just keep in mind, when you're exchanging the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c for the \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49, there's a chance you might not be able to rent a car.   When I went to rent a car the next day, agency asked for an entry stamp from my US passport, \"ehhh well... I came in on a \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49\u526f\u672c. \"  Undeterred,  I proudly presented my newly minted ID and they said,  you can rent as a resident but we now need a Taiwan Drivers License.  What.  Oh well, it was all taxis all the way after that.   If you can get your drivers license authenticated before arriving, you can then get it exchanged for Taiwan license.  I wish I had the time to get it done this time.)",

Adding my experience applying for \u5b9a\u5c45\u8b49 where my mother's HHR was expired (she hasn't been back in many years and doesn't plan to).

I made a trip with him to his local district office where he requested an original \u6236\u7c4d\u8b04\u672c.

I went and grabbed some photos in the basement of the NIA before I flew back too since I figured those would be safe.\n\nI went down to the Houston office early last week to get get birth certificate authenticated and then applied for the NWOHR passport. I got to the office a bit earlier since I was driving down from Dallas so left a little earlier to account for the 4-5 hour drive. The whole process started 9 am and I was out of there by 10 am (took about an hour). It didn't seem like they had that many people come in so walk-ins might be more easy at this location? (it seemed like most of the people that came after me were also walk-ins and just grabbed a number), but it perhaps might've been just that I came in early. Only my dad is an NWHR while my mom is just a US citizen, but since they already had a \u6236\u53e3\u540d\u7c3f documenting marriage in the US and explaining name change (mom's maiden name to my dad's last name), it went pretty smoothly. It seems without that document it would've been more of a pain since my mom's current passport doesn't match marriage certifcate exactly and probably would've had to authenticate marriage certificate too but I guess my parents already did that at some point for some other function. \n\nAnyways, I received the authenticated birth certificate back in the mail two days ago and am now waiting for the NWOHR passport. I was told that the passport would be ready in approximately 1.5 months which they would mail to me (you need to pay for the priority mail envelopes for both). \n\nI got the FBI background check done and mailed to TECRO, so hopefully with that and the NWOHR passport I can book another flight to Taiwan and complete part 2 of the process smoothly.",

TSMC even abided by the US request to shift production capacity to the US, and the reason was that Taiwan is geopolitically unstable.   It was only when they realize it's not working well did they start boasting about protecting Taiwan at all costs, refuting all the anti-american sentiments in Taiwan. Right now the US get their best chips from Taiwan (while it's highly demanded around the world).   I wouldn't say that's not giving anything.   But aside from chips, we can also argue how Taiwan is standing in the front line of this entity which Trump/Vance see as the biggest threat to the US.

An additional point of view on those topics:\n\nChinese vs Taiwanese: not much to add you hit it pretty well.\n\nEnglish friendly: absolutely! I was shocked after Korea, but again it\u2019s been a long time since my last visit so maybe English is more common than before (though I find signage and navigation in Seoul to be superior to Taipei)\n\nProgressive: I had culture shock after coming here and was so happy to see people being so free about this openly in Taipei\n\nEating out: local food is still cheap (and more so outside Taipei) depends on location, but still even foreign food is not bad at all (grocery shopping for healthy food can still be costly though)\n\nAssimilation: dead on with acceptance, there is still a lot of stereotypes but overall Taiwan is very accepting and open minded. Another culture shock and feel Taiwan is a bit more \u201cwesternized\u201d in mixing modern day cultures, but as a foreigner it also makes me feel \u201cless connected\u201d to the culture than Korea to be honest, I felt more of a cultural exchange there than here.\n\nDrinking culture: Taiwan doesn\u2019t really have it, if you are still in the area the Taihu/Draftland area of Xinyi is nice open air drinking, otherwise it\u2019s pretty much small gatherings at KTVs, house parties, or a couple drinks indoors at a bar with friends, some of the foreigner hangout places carry a bit more of the drinking style of Korea. But to be honest I get way more hangovers here so calming down on the drinking felt like it comes with the territory.\n\nWeather: when it\u2019s nice it\u2019s nice, as others said sometimes the excessive humidity can make some very uncomfortable summers and winters.\n\nGood looking people: beautiful people in every country! But I\u2019m surprised by the gym rat comment \ud83d\ude02 when I lived in Korea most guys were very skinny and very few gym rats, in Taiwan I see vastly more, in fact almost every gym I go to seem to have a lot of steroids or PEDs going around (if anyone has a hookup send a DM my way, I feel I need the boost haha)\n\nInfrastructure: yeah\u2026\n\nCash: when I first came to Taiwan almost nowhere accepted cards, it\u2019s gotten a lot better the last few years specifically but going from America to Korea (and many trips to Japan) to Taiwan I was shocked that I \u201cneeded\u201d cash nearly everywhere, even with a Taiwanese bank credit card.\n\nI hope you have an awesome time!

I am a Sinologist from Denmark, I speak, read and write Chinese, my area of expertise is Taiwanese and mainland politics, and diplomacy.\n\nPossibility of invasion.\nYes of course it is possible. What is the likelihood of it happening? Less than Russia going into the balkans.\n\nThe question is, why would the PRC invade Taiwan and what are the consequences of that. \nSo we need to develop multiple scenarios. First scenario the ROC declares independence tomorrow and apply to become a member of NATO, ASEAN, UN and so on. I would say there is a 100% chance for invasion. In this scenario. At least right now. What could reduce the chances of an invasion? Nothing that is a realistic to happen. \n\n\nLet us say it is 2040 and we are almost at the 100 year anniversary of the CCP taking control over the PRC. If nothing has changed and the PRC manage the economic situation, the diplomatic situation, the technological situation, and have modernized their entire military, then I would put the chances of high. I would not say that it is a given. Because it is not. Why do I say that? The PRC have been screaming for over 70 years that they are going to invade any time now. Any time now. And almost nothing happened. \nSo what would increase the chances of an invasion for this scenario? Reduced risks of invasion. Controlling the South China Sea. Having friends who are willing to be subjected to wide economic sanctions because they are supplying the PRC with important goods such as energy. And more. \n\n\nSo I don't think an invasion is going to come any time soon, unless the Chinese economy faces a crisis, and also the tech industry falls to stagnation. Then China have little to lose by invading, but a lot to win.",

Due to 36 years of their one child policy, their entire military is staffed with sons (most of whom do not yet have families of their own) who are only children.

I am not good at squatting, much less due to the state I was in, but eventually steadied myself by precariously leaning back and supporting myself with my hand against the wall.\n\nAfter one of the most awkward bowel movements of all time, I noticed that there was no toilet paper. I checked to make sure the coast was clear and scuttled to the next stall. Still nothing. I ended up doing the best I could with some spare notepaper I had in my pocket, and left. Found out later that it was common practice back then for many people to carry around their own personal tissue packages for just such occasions. \n\nThis is definitely not a thing anymore, and \u53f0\u5317\u8eca\u7ad9 toilets are all fancy bidet-equipped now, but it was certainly an interesting first experience in Taiwan.",

It's cheap, frequent enough.\n\nDelays aren't all that frequent and well managed for what is largely a circle around the island. The South Link Line has now been electrified, although it could do with some passing loops and double tracking in places to cut down on the delays it has, it's a bit of a weak spot, one late train can cause a snowball effect. There are just 3 local trains a day, I wish there were more.\n\nI largely use the TRA for cycle rides. It has gotten infinitely easier in the last 5 years to take a bike on a train. There are more stations than ever you can get on with your bike, more trains than ever you can get on. The intro of the fast local services has really helped.",

Sure it\u2019s not as new or advanced as Taipei metro or the bullet train, but it serves its purpose and has done so for quite a few years. \n\nDoes it need infrastructure improvements? Yes. However, the price is cheap enough for everyday people in Taiwan. Do not judge what you\u2019ve yet to experience. Keep in mind there\u2019s people who make $20-30k NT per month and students as well. \n\nThat\u2019s my experience.

The law states that companies with 30+ workers had to provide health insurance. \n\nPapa John's was furious, since they were legally not even having to pay their drivers minimum wage, since they got tips. The next thing they did was why I've boycotted them ever since. \n\nThey said, fine. If we have to pay more to our employees, we are passing it on to our customers. So they retaliated by raising the price of pizza, to punish their customers (voters).\n\nA company that profits millions of years, not willing to let it affect their wallets. \n\nChina is not going to lose any money from these tariffs. They will pass the cost on to consumers. \n\nThe last, and most important part, is Temu. \n\nTemu is growing a customer base faster than Amazon did. Amazon cannot undercut their prices. While I don't find it a coincidence, Amazon announced they will start selling low priced goods, like Temu, right around the time Trump announced the tariffs. \n\nIt seems Trump is doing the tariffs thing to help the richest man in the world, while he's obviously making deals with Elon Musk as well. \n\nThis is what selling out the American people looks like.",

        "body": "Trump is not, and never has been the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters. And the point needs to be driven home that he, in fact, wasn't \"better for the economy\"\n\n- Trump inherited a growing economy. All he had to do was ride those coattails, but as soon as a real crisis emerged\u2014the covid pandemic\u2014he mismanaged it at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden. What's frustrating, is that Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time.\n\n- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee an economic recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans exploited both opportunities to point fingers at their opponents, choosing to take advantage of a crisis for political gain and campaign talking points.\n\n- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% \n\n- Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \"pay for itself,\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.\n\n- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge. This only worsened inflationary issues.\n\n- The Trump administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.\n\n- Trump didn't just mismanage the pandemic, but he shirked responsibility and encouraged his supporters to politicize every aspect of COVID, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.\n\n- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.\n\n*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*\n\nNow, to elaborate more on Trump's tariffs.\n\nMost economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.\n\nThis was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency. To put it simply, it hurt Americans BIGLY. \n\nAnd now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.\n\nWe haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.\n\nThe process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and a process that Trump couldn't be bothered with. It should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations. Things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved.\n\nTrump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.\n\nThey will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources and less power to manage the consequences.\n\n> In general, it is believed that Trump\u2019s tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs.\n\n> In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy.\n\n> A CNBC study discovered that Trump\u2019s tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.\n\nAnd when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:\n\n***The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trump\u2019s tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.***\n\nThe trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.\n\nAs the trade war continued:\n\n> tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and people\u2019s livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly allies\n\nTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the consequences are estimated to be severe. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \"national sales tax.\" Most of the damage is expected to trickle down to consumers and small businesses. While it's very likely that Trump doesn't even know how tariffs work.\n\nTrump is not an \"economic genius,\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. He's bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product or service he's tried to slap his name on.\n\nTrump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of them including financial crimes.\n\nTax information also shows that over a period of time in the 80s and 90s, Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. What a loser! Literally...\n\nHere's a long list of Trump's business failures:\n\n- Trump Casinos and Hotels \n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\n- Trump Magazine\n- Trump Airlines\n- Trump Beverages\n- Trump \"The Game\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\n- Trump Mortgages\n- Trump Steaks\n- Trump Travel Site\n- Trumpnet\n- Trump Tower Tampa\n- Trump Vodka\n- Trump Fragrances\n- Trump Mattress\n- Trump Network\n- Tour de Trump\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\n- Truth Social (why not call it \"Trump Social\" at this point?)\n\nDonald Trump is not some financial guru, his administrations \"economic achievements,\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.\n\nBefore The Apprentice, Trump had squandered his riches, and if it weren't for his lucky reality TV show break, he'd be known as the failure he was always destined to be.\n\nThe next Trump administration will destroy what's left of the labor movement, which has been in steady decline ever since Reagan stepped into office. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of a crowd of union workers, where he said he \"hated\" giving overtime pay.\n\nOver the next four years, the MAGA coalition will use Trump to implement an agenda that will continue to redistribute wealth to the top, an agenda that Republicans have been working towards for decades.\n\nEven Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \"mass deportation\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP. And make no mistake, the new Trump administration will have *all* immigrants in their sights.",

Is he planning on destroying all unions and drastically lowering U.S. avg income, to make us competitive with Mexico?  \n\nHow does this not result in sharp inflation in costs and deflation in wages?

No, it's because he's learned in the past four years that TikTok is a shockingly efficient disseminator of disinformation, which is Trump's main stock-in-trade. \"I\u2019m now a big star on TikTok,\" he bragged in September, vowing to protect the site from being banned. He's also buddied up with the chief executive of the American division of TikTok, Shou Chew, inviting him to join the murder's row of tech billionaires attending the inauguration. \n> \n> . . .\n> \n> TikTok is good for Trump, and for one simple reason: It is a maelstrom of disinformation so gargantuan that even Elon Musk-controlled Twitter fails to compete. It's a train wreck of B.S., from people claiming sunscreen and vaccines don't work to bizarre videos claiming demons infect everything to old-fashioned authoritarian lies. The company claims to stand for \"free speech,\" but the Chinese government censors information that doesn't serve its political goals. The algorithm is hidden from public view, but it's easy to see it favors divisive, emotionally manipulative and misleading information. It ratchets up culture war tensions and stokes arguments while undermining people's mental ability to focus on developing solutions. Hundreds of millions of people willingly plug into an app that feeds them the demoralizing propaganda authoritarians have been trying to shove down our throats forever. It's a fascist's dream.",

People respected one another and didn't care what each other's beliefs are.\n\nWhat happened to that?\n\nNow everywhere you go, everyone HAS to know what your political affiliations are. Everyone HAS to know what religious deity you believe in. And worst of all, if someone even slightly disagrees with you on something, you get shunned. To add to it, when people make friends, political and/or religious beliefs completely make or break a friendship. Whereas before, friends were friends regardless if they were liberal or conservative, or Christian or Atheist. I've met people who were on opposing sides for nearly decades and were the best of friends. But then one day one of them is like \"I'm not friends with them anymore because they're conservative\". Like nothing happened between the two of them in particular, it's just that \"oh I found out they're conservative and now want nothing to do with them\".\n\nAnd here's what bothers me the most now: If you don't want to talk about it yourself, tough luck, because everyone else wants you to know what THEIR beliefs are. They'll proclaim it proudly, put it on flags all over their yards (and they'll find the biggest ones they can too, just for that extra emphasis), their cars, and on their clothes and make sure you know that they want so-and-so for president or that they voted for yes/no on something political. Hell, I can't walk two feet away from my house without seeing how much people want to \"fuck Joe Biden\", for example. I can't even imagine being a child who isn't even old enough to know about what's going on and seeing things like that everywhere they go.\n\nWhy can't we just respect each other and our beliefs? Why are we like waging war on each other now over this sort of stuff? Granted, people talked about politics before, but nowhere *near* the scale of it these days or the past few years.",

Ford plans to make as many as 2 million EVs by 2026, a huge increase from the roughly 132,000 it produced last year.",

James Lankford, a key negotiator of the deal, was intimidated by a [\u2018popular commentator\u2019](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/07/senate-schumer-ukraine-israel-republicans-democrats-border) not to try to solve the border crisis during this presidential year.\nSpeaker Johnson also said the deal would be [\u201cdead on arrival\u201d](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/house-speaker-johnson-says-border-deal-dead-arrival-current-form-cnn-2024-01-26/) at the House. \n\nThen, the Senate passed a proposal linked only to $95bn in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan by an overwhelming majority of 70-29. But [Mike Johnson now said](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4463791-speaker-johnson-ukraine-aid-rebuff/amp/) it won\u2019t even let the House vote on the matter because the bill doesn\u2019t address border security.",

If shared with others, the people said, such information could expose intelligence-gathering methods that the United States wants to keep hidden from the world.\n\nAt least one of the documents seized by the FBI describes Iran\u2019s missile program, according to these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation. Other documents described highly sensitive intelligence work aimed at China, they said.\n\nUnauthorized disclosures of specific information in the documents would pose multiple risks, experts say. People aiding U.S. intelligence efforts could be endangered, and collection methods could be compromised. In addition, other countries or U.S. adversaries could retaliate against the United States for actions it has taken in secret.\n\nThe secret documents about Iran and China are considered among the most sensitive the FBI has recovered to date in its investigation of Trump and his aides for possible mishandling of classified information, obstruction and destruction of government records, the people said.\n\nThe former president has denied wrongdoing in having the documents at Mar-a-Lago, claiming in a recent television interview that he declassified any documents in his possession, and that a president can declassify information \u201ceven by thinking about it.\u201d\n\nA Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday morning.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/10/21/trump-documents-mar-a-lago-iran-china/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/10/21/trump-documents-mar-a-lago-iran-china/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",

Goods in general have increased in price by 12% some items like refrigerators jumped up 20% because of the increase in steel prices.\n\nGiven that the trade imbalance favours China by quite some degree they do more to hurt us than it does people in China. China is able to swap soybean production to South America or swap to a different food source.\n\nGiven that China is the centre of production for all electric items such as chips and boards it is just not possible to move supplier. No matter what Trump says those jobs are not coming back to the USA no company is going to employee 1 US worker for every 10 Chinese at the same price.\n\nSo not only do we get hit with paying the Traffs in the first place that money which goes to the government then has to be used to prop up the Farming Industry which is effected by reduced demand from China.\n\nTariffs in trade wars just does not work. The people that are impacted are the consumers it just becomes a tit of tat between the countries. Yes we need to deal with the way China does business but as Joe said unite with other countries to bring them to account.\n\nBecause being stuck in a trade war for 4 years has done nothing but increase prices for everyone.",

They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that is newly formed, and all these companies, did you look at, And by the way, likewise China should start an investigation, into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with uhhh with Ukraine. So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were ME, I would recommend that they start and investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked.That was a crooked deal 100%. He had no knowledge of energy. Didnt know the first thing about it. All of a sudden he's getting $50,000, plus a lot of other things, nobody has anydoubt.

Pose questions that force him to show he has no compassion for Americans. Get him so riled up in this meltdown that he says some unforgivable shit about innocent civilians. We are still playing a game of legality/intellectualism and we need to play to people\u2019s instincts and emotions about this instead of trying to grasp it mentally. This guy is dangerous to America and the actual and potential harm needs to be made clear. Democrats and the news media need to change the narrative and force this asshole to talk about the concerns of many Americans about his actions. Legality aside, we need to invoke the visceral reaction of danger for people by forcing him to talk about those of us who do not approve of him. \n\n> do you worry that your comments about civil war and a coup can cause harm to innocent Americans? If this kind of violence occurs, many people WILL BLAME YOU and many people are scared of your behavior. What do you say to those Americans? \n\n> if the whistleblower is outed and assassinated, many American citizens will look to your words as the cause, what do you say to those Americans? \n\n> many Americans want a fair and free election and worry about foreign powers interfering in our elections because most of us agree that part of what makes America great is our democracy. What do you say to those Americans about your ask of foreign governments to interfere? \n\n> the news media has reported that you told Russian officials you didn\u2019t care if they meddled in the 2020 elections. Regardless of whether or not you accept they meddled in 2016, what do you have to say to those Americans who feel your  own words in interviews and on Twitter are an invitation to Russia, China, or any other nation to meddle in our elections? \n\n> many Americans are worried about what they view as your increasingly erratic behavior. If the senate votes to convict you, will you leave the office peacefully? \n\n> I work for CNN. Would you care if I were murdered?\n\nLet\u2019s start holding this fuckface accountable to his face and reveal how evil he really is to anyone who thinks he\u2019s just dumb and unaware. Snap out of it and force him to either talk about American citizens with this rhetoric and admit he doesn\u2019t care about >50% of us and would be fine if we were murdered or force him to avoid those pointed questions and deny blame deny blame. He will flounder and lose any support of reasonable people that he still may have if the news media targets WHAT HE SAYS and what it means to normal Americans. The more we feed into his narcissism and don\u2019t target these questions to echo with the worries about our safety, the more we play on his turf. Ask him about Americans and let him brush us off or let him openly try to incite violence against us.\n\nEdit: I know this is potentially more dangerous, but we need honest, naked, and disturbing truth to snap the fuck out of it before it\u2019s too late. This behavior from the President undermines the fabric of our society and is dangerous and it needs to feel as urgent as it is.\n\nEdit 2: ty for the silver!

The report confirmed that the Trump campaign attempted to solicit the support of the Russian government, however Mueller was unable to establish a conspiracy. The Mueller report points out that the Trump campaign had improper conduct with Russia on numerous occasions. However they found that the value of the contact was not sufficient to rise to the level of a federal crime. The report goes to lengths explaining how difficult the investigation was due to obstruction and lying by those that were being investigated.^[[14]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)**\n\n- Mueller report confirmed that Trump campaign chairman and deputy chairman Manafort and Gates were sharing internal polling data with an operative who Gates had thought was a Russian spy. \n\n- The Mueller report confirmed that Trump campaign manager and convicted felon Paul Manafort offered to give private briefings during the campaign to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\n\n- Following Trump's public call for Russia to find Clinton's missing emails he privately directed former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to find them. \n\n- The Mueller report confirmed that foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos attempted to arrange meetings between Putin and Trump and that the President approved of Papadopoulos's work. \n\n- The report also confirmed that Trump campaign surrogates met with Russians in Trump Tower soliciting damaging information on their political opponent. The report goes on to mention that Trump surrogates who attended the meeting weren't charged with violating campaign finance law because there wasn\u2019t admissible evidence to show that Trump surrogates knew that what they were doing was illegal.\n\n- The report confirmed Russia's extensive election interference.\n\n- Over the course of the investigation we learned that a Trump campaign adviser was directed to find out about future DNC leaks. Roger Stone was in contact with Wikileaks and the Russian hackers known as Guciffer 2.0 and is currently on trial. \n\n- Over the course of the investigation we learned that the President's long time personal attorney and convicted felon Michael Cohen lied to Congress about the Trump Organization pursuing a lucrative hotel project in Moscow during the 2016 election.\n\nThe report outlines the Trump campaign sought to create a relationship with the Russian government. The same foreign adversary that was and currently is engaged in cyberwarfare with the United States of America. The report illustrates the Trump campaign showing a willingness to work with a foreign adversary to acquire damaging information on a political opponent. All while denying Russian election interference and refusing to notify the authorities of any overtures made to the campaign after they had been warned about election interference by the FBI. The report is quite illuminating and confirms many media reports including the fact that the President attempted to fire the Special Counsel while trying to force his subordinates to lie for him to investigators. It's all in the report and while its 448 pages long it's incredibly descriptive. \n\n_______\n\n1) [Cornell Law - 52 U.S. Code\u00a7\u202f30121.Contributions and donations by foreign nationals](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121)\n\n2) [Wall Street Journal - Pompeo Took Part in Ukraine Call, Official Says](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pompeo-took-part-in-ukraine-call-official-says-11569865002?tesla=y)\n\n3) [BBC - Trump impeachment: Pompeo confirms listening in on Ukraine call](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49909726)\n\n4) [The Guardian - New reports reveal wider role for Barr and Pompeo in impeachment scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/barr-pompeo-trump-ukraine-australia-2020)\n\n5) [New York Times - Trump Pressed Australian Leader to Help Barr Investigate Mueller Inquiry\u2019s Origins](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/trump-australia-barr-mueller.html)\n\n6) [The Guardian - William Barr discussed FBI Russia inquiry with UK intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/william-barr-us-attorney-general-discussed-mueller-inquiry-uk-intelligence)\n\n7) [The Times - Donald Trump impeachment: President called Boris Johnson for help to discredit Mueller inquiry](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/donald-trump-impeachment-president-called-boris-johnson-for-help-to-discredit-mueller-inquiry-jlkztnfpx)\n\n8) [Fox News - Impeachment probe rapidly widens as Dems fire off subpoenas, set testimony](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-probe-rapidly-widens-as-dems-fire-off-subpoenas-set-testimony)\n\n9) [Reuters - U.S. Democrats subpoena Trump lawyer Giuliani in impeachment probe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-congress/trump-lawyer-giuliani-subpoenaed-by-u-s-house-democrats-idUSKBN1WF24H?il=0)\n\n10) [Axios - Giuliani hires attorney to represent him in Ukraine investigation](https://www.axios.com/rudy-giuliani-lawyer-ukraine-investigation-7b8fd109-d9da-45c4-a689-bfd9b1a50f2c.html)\n\n11) [New York Times - Trump Seeks Whistle-Blower\u2019s Identity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/trump-schiff-treason.html)\n\n12) [The Hill - Pompeo rejects Dem demands for officials' testimony](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/463827-pompeo-balks-at-dems-subpoena-i-will-not-tolerate-house-efforts-to)\n\n13) [The Independent - Trump administration officials agree to testify about Ukraine call for impeachment investigation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-ukraine-investigation-testify-call-a9128826.html)\n\n14) [Department of Justice - Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In the 2016 Presidential Election](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)",

        "body": "> But Trump himself is tens of millions of dollars in debt to China: In 2012, his real estate partner refinanced one of Trump\u2019s most prized New York buildings for almost $1 billion. **The debt includes $211 million from the state-owned Bank of China \u2014 its first loan of this kind in the U.S. \u2014 which matures in the middle of what could be Trump\u2019s second term**, [financial records](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/899689/000089968920000010/vno-123119xexhibit992x.htm) show. \n\nBurying the lede by saying \"tens of millions of dollars\" rather than just saying \"**hundreds of millions of dollars in debt**\" and then not digging further into *why* he was selected by the Chinese government to be the first recipient of this type of loan in the entire U.S..\n\n \n\n>Aside from the historic precedent of a developer-turned president paying back millions to a bank controlled a foreign government, \n\nAnd why is this historic? Oh, right; because Trump--enabled by his Republican loyalists--has continually broken the law and violated the Constitution by not divesting upon taking office.  It is \"historic\" because of the blatant and unprecedented corruption.  \n\nPut another way, we've never had a President with such bad credit that only foreign, government owned banks would lend to that person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the 2012 Bank of China deal also stands out because Trump and his campaign have repeatedly highlighted the same bank's role in a $1.5 billion deal announced in 2013 by partners of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden. \n\nClassic Republican projection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Critics of the Bidens have seized on the fact that the agreement materialized just days after Hunter Biden traveled to China with the then-vice president, who was there on official business.  \n>  \n>\u201cWhy did the Chinese government's bank want to do business with Hunter Biden while his dad was Vice President,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign asked on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1248627139420790784) earlier this month. The issue was also raised in a[ campaign ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv7yVCwv6NU&feature=youtu.be) the day before, one in a stream of criticisms about the China deal raised by campaign spokespeople and Trump since last year.\n\nI don't know--why did they lend to a U.S. citizen unable to secure any lending outside of Russia's state bank? Why did they grant Trump and his daughter highly sought after trademarks for all manner of products after Trump met privately with Chinese leadership?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Trump campaign has steadily increased its focus on trying to portray Biden as weak on China amid rising voter disapproval of China, the source of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump surrogate Corey Lewandowski dubbed him \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d in an online campaign event Wednesday. And during a White House press briefing Saturday, Trump said China will \u201cown\u201d the U.S. if Biden wins.\n\nCorey Lewandowski found a moment of his precious time that would otherwise be spent assaulting\\[[1](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/27/ex-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-accused-of-sexual-assault)\\] women\\[[2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/video-shows-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-grabbing-michelle-fields/2016/03/29/8b53c8a4-f5c2-11e5-958d-d038dac6e718_video.html)\\] and talking with the police, to pilot test a nickname for his boss.\n\nThis type of person would seriously be a scandal unto itself in any Democratic administration. What's next? We going to wait for Rob Porter to wipe his wife's *and* his mistress' blood off his bruised knuckles before getting his hot take as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But Trump\u2019s recent criticisms of China have been muddied by his own [mixed messaging](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/trump-china-coronavirus-148806) as well as by his numerous financial ties to the country. Those connections extend far beyond the Avenue of the America\u2019s loan: Chinese state-owned companies are constructing two luxury Trump developments in [United Arab Emirates](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article172443417.html) and [Indonesia](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/01/trump-resort-south-korea-government-1390736). The president and his daughter Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser, have been awarded trademarks by China\u2019s government. And his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has courted Chinese investors in at least [one other](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-business.html?module=inline) real estate deal.  \n>  \n>\u201cWe actually explored all these foreign enterprises and how once he became president he\u2019d be seen differently by foreign leaders who would have leverage over this president because he had investments in their countries and/or financial dealings with business enterprises and financial institutions and investors in their countries,\u201d said **Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight Committee. \u201cHe is highly conflicted with respect to China.\u201d**\n\nGerry Connolly should not be making statements if this is the best he has for such a serious situation.  Democrats need to put their most assertive figures in charge of messaging.  People don't care if they hear he is highly conflicted with respect to China.  They've heard that song and dance for almost 4 years now, in addition to other countries.  They need to just say what we all know in order to keep in the forefront of people's minds: **Trump and his family members who are appointed jobs owes China money** ***and*** **favors**. That comes due starting next year. Are your kids' future worth sacrificing at the altar of a supreme malignant narcissist?",

They've strayed from them at the ballot box, but farmers by and large still use credit unions and the companies they sell to have profit sharing agreements. Imagine paying your bank loan and getting a equity check at the end of the year... for owing money. Everyone should have access to that.

The people who double down on Trump right now deserve what they get to a degree, but when they go bankrupt and \"sell the land\" (the nightmare of every farmer), some larger business is going to scoop it up, and we all know how they vote.\n\nMaybe next time you see an article about how farmers are being destroyed, even if some of it was at their own hands, instead of cheering their demise, you could say, \"Well, it's a bit more complicated than that.\" Just like everything else.

Check\n\n- Being corrupt and aloof from the people? Check\n\n- Lazy and golfs too much? Check\n\n- Controlled by lobbyists and special interests? Check\n\n- Threatening to take guns away? Check\n\n- Making threats to America's democracy? Check\n\n- Being weak on foreign dictators? Check\n\n- Being a war hawk? Check\n\n- Dividing the nation along class, race, gender, age, political party lines with his rhetoric? Check\n\n- Being egotistical, ignorant, inexperienced and involving his family in the presidency? Check\n\n- Lying constantly to the public and politicizing every issue, including scientific ones? Check\n\n- Hurting the economy with dumb decisions? Check\n\n- Making America into a global joke and disgrace, lowering the image of the country in its allies' eyes? Check\n\nIf this was a movie, it would be criticized for making the followup villain too cartoonish and too on the nose for pointing out Republican hypocrisy.
